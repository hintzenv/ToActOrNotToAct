When I started this gig, I was theonly guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry inCalifornia.  I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all theimportant stuff.  This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write hisown Burrito.  His epistle got more press than mine, but why is hemuscling in on my turf?  Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynchreleased a report which looks into every facet of California?s powerbusiness.  No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enoughroom in this business for all of us.  They need to clear out.With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davisand Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?  They re-define ourreality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.  For example, starting inearly June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against otherQualified Trading Vehicles.  Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrerlegislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for atleast one year.  This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals forPG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculatingthe PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom.I can?t wait to see what next week will bring.  I hear Senator Bowen isholding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and theGovernor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:What?s for lunch?Who will sit at the head of the table?Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention?Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry?Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?  It?s getting toowarm.Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena,ignore the facts, and publish a report.  It makes one want to take adeep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere.>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!>>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?Well, the answer very clearly is no.  I have been astounded by repeatedattempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead theymimic apes.Consider the following.  First, they waltz their default customers intothe summer with little of no protection from price spikes in thewholesale market.  Forgivable in that it is human to err.  The pricesskyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame.  _Must bethem damn independent generators,O say their managers.  Gary Cottoninforms the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in theBlock Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference.  There?s onenobel laureate who missed his prime.Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone elsewho will assist the utility and their customers.  Nine offers show up attheir table, and they can?t choose any of them.  Again, Mr Cotton tellshis fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, andwe don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well,the surfing was good this week so why spoil it?Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladiesliving in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&Eelectricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone thatSDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills,including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can helpby calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] andurging them to lower the cap.  I always thought the location of the ISOwas a State secret for security reasons.  No secrets in San Diego.But we are not done.  No sir, we are not.  Those buffalo heads who runthat company decide they will win a gold star on their collectiveforeheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by theElectric Oversight Board.  The one they pick is to petition FERC on anexpedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bidenergy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX.  The primaryreason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive.  Inother words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators cansell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy!What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&Econtinues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must runenergy into the PX.   These are sales from their stranded assets.  Theirgrief hasn?t abated their greed.So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to winconsumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliersand did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale pricebecause the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energyis not workably competitive.  Too much time in the direct sun light.>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing reportThe PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spentenough time.  I only read the Executive Summary, and that only becauseour counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some ofthe gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito.  I would recommendreading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverseentertainment._California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply andpricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past tenyears._ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California haveincreased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting inover $1 billion in excess   payments for electricity._Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, anddysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combinedto drive prices up ..._Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity,purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more inelectricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do notnecessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or deliveryreliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins._Despite the Electricity Oversight Board s legislative mandate tooversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data.Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behaviorexists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation intothese statewide market practices, coordinating with other Stateagencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation wouldprovide the factual foundation that California policy makers andregulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits._A momentous consequence of California s attempt to create a market inelectricity is that the federal government now regulates California selectric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directlyat the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to theextent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C.now affects California s ability to attract new investment in powerplants._Past administrations  willingness to cede the State s authority to thefederal government combined with the legislative creation of twonon-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect thepublic or consider the retail customer. The \"Independent SystemOperator\" (ISO) and the \"Power Exchange\" (PX), the nonprofit privatecorporations that operate the State s transmission system and controlwholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members canhave serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or theircompanies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State orits consumers ...._Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State selectric services, the State of California should protect its businessesand consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate powerplant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricitysupplies._California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as SanDiegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essentialservice like electricity will double. California is now largelyconstrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retailprice relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If Californiatried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulatorswould likely prevent that action.  ... Short-term price relief, however,cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problemscontrolled by federal regulators. _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know ifthe ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on severalfronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering andbidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry intonational pricing and energy market issues. California should not waitfor national findings before it investigates California marketpractices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediatelysubpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offeringbehavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its boardmembers; and the actions of generators in supplying California s energyneeds._Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current ElectricityProblems From Spreading in 2001: ...     2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National     Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy     problems and to perform integrated energy planning;     3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to     moderate California wholesale market pricing;     4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and     western regional markets and find that no competitive market     exists in California power markets;...      8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX     stakeholder boards;     9. Improve California s ability to obtain ISO and generator     data and enhance the State s enforcement capability for power     plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming,     consistent with protection of proprietary business     information;     10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and     additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX._Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ...     4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent     with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications     to advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals.     5. Institute \"use-it -or- lose-it\" permitting power plant     licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants     get built;     ...      8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower     wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsOI told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore.  The Democrats inSacramento are doing that for me.  Welcome comrade.>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Boardmeeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.  It seems the onlytime the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on theagenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements.Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum.%Round and %round we went, once again.  A few more forced votes tippedthe scale in favor of the cap.  There were 15 yes votes, which includeda forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary ofEnergy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters ofyour name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO?  Kind of a frenchthing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry.  You still go in my book asone of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidationfor so long.  Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet(Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), CaolynKehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble).Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No,spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO.   I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francisin Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.  We?re going towork things out.The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again.  I didn?t mind that I onlyhad a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr(Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes.  That didn?t bother me at all.  Hedid more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.  He blasted awayat everyone who opposed him.  He pined about Camden quitting the Board.He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way thoseacademic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the godsof competition.  He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protectfish and wildlife (what was that all about?).  He predicted that onThursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats,Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUCimpose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are justand reasonable (it didn?t happen).  And on and on and on.  This man isvery delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can savethe world.  He believes that political will trumps judicial,quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.  This man makes relevantall the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche(1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation ofvalues, etc.But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press.Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if hethought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over.Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would notcome to the meeting.  Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, andall of it bad.That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one stepaway from our front door. >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley OrderAnd now, the good news.  You deserve this.  FERC gave the Californiamarket a little wiggle room last Friday.  FERC issued a last minutereply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to theISO?s intent to lower the price cap.  FERC denied the complaint, butthey didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint.  FERCdanced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap.Here are some excerpts:_We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers?prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the marketby clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing topay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether tosell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere..._ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energythan any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable toelicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase priceceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose),it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meetits needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls forgeneration may be necessary to maintain system reliability.  Because thecurrent payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, theresulting overall payments may be higher._To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing adirective that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO marketsunder any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), sucha requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ...Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to arequirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISOmarket rules.  Such market changes could not become effective absent acorresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filedunder section 205 of the FPA.OWell. What do you think about that?Just wait.  Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said inhis concurring remarks:_Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begina proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of theCalifornia grid.  The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum tothe ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing boardeloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine theindependence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlinesconsequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.?_Because these allegations come from a non-market participant,especially should we take heed.  We must also take notice of the publicpressure on the Board to compromise its independence.OAmen, brother, amen.>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks beforethis has been interminable.  I get about three phone calls a day frompress reporters, very little of which ever sees print.  My shtick isjust too complex for casual readers.  But I do notice that the reportersare asking better questions.  The public is becoming more savvy.  Theinformation flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces ofevil, in about 10 years.I have other problems on my mind.  I am working on a new computersystem.  Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bitfaster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.  As aresult of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my officelooks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computerdocumentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess.Prepare for the future.  Our next general meeting is scheduled forThursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.  Barb Ennis willprepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations,timing, golf, etc.  Our guest speakers will include MSC ChairmanProfessor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms.Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make apresentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, andWilliam Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us someeducation on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO.Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.  Last weekwe had a joke about Catholics.  This week it?s agnostics.=====================An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that theaccident  of evolution had created.  \"What majestic trees!  Whatpowerful rivers! What  beautiful animals!\"  he said to himself.As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushesbehind him.  As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bearcharging  towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path.  Helooked over his  shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.He tried to run even  faster, so scared that tears were coming to hiseyes. His heart was pumping  frantically as he tried to run even faster,but he tripped and fell on the  ground.  He rolled over to pick himselfup and saw the bear right on top of  him raising its paw to kill him.At that instant he cried out \"Oh my God!\" And time stopped. The bearfroze.  The forest was silent.  The river even stopped flowing.  Abright light shone  upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, \"Youdeny my existence all  these years, teach others I don t exist and evencredit my creation to a  cosmic accident, and now do you expect me tohelp you out of this  predicament?  Am I to count you as a believer?\"The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, \"It would berather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all theseyears,  but could you make the bear a believer?\"\"Very well\" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed,the  sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both pawstogether,  bowed his head, and said, \"Lord, I thank you for this foodwhich I am about  to receive.\"==================Amen.  And have a great weekend.  Oh, and thanks to all of you who sentme happy birthday wishes.  It was very much appreciated.KSBgba - att1.htm",

There is a beautiful story of an overworked nurse who escorted a= tired, young man to her patient s bed -side. Leaning over and speaking lou=dly to the elderly patient, she said, \"Your son is here.\"   With great effo=rt, his unfocussed eyes opened, then flickered shut again. The young man sq=ueezed the aged hand in his and sat beside the bed. Throughout the night he= sat there, holding the old man s hand and whispering words of comfort.   B=y morning s light, the patient had died. In moments, hospital staff swarmed= into the room to turn off machines and remove needles. The nurse stepped o=ver to the young man s side and began to offer sympathy, but he interrupted= her.   \"Who was that man?\" he asked.   The startled nurse replied, \"I thou=ght he was your father!\" \"No, he was not my father\", he answered. I never s=aw him before in my life.\" \"Then, why didn t you say something when I took =you to him?\"   \"I realized he needed his son and his son wasn t here\", the =man explained. \"And since he was too sick to recognize that I was not his s=on, I knew he needed me.\"   Mother Teresa used to remind us that nobody sho=uld have to die alone.

The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International union has notified major oil companies that it may order a strike as early as today, unless progress was made in contract negotiations involving almost 30,000 of its members. The March crude oil contract moved between $18.95 and $19.50, with gains of about $0.29 coming in after reports of the strike. The market continues to look for proof that production cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC exporters will be effective. Heating oil and gasoline prices crept higher on a pre-expiry short-covering rally. Refinery run cuts and planned maintenance also helped to support product prices. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0138 to $0.5229 per gallon. March heating oil futures rose $0.0185 to $0.5316 per gallon. Gasoline futures for February delivery on the NYMEX increased $0.0061 to $0.5592 per gallon. March gasoline futures climbed $0.0128 to $0.5742 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were up $0.39 to $19.18 per barrel. -------------------------------------------------------------????????????????????NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures12 Month Strip ?2.5179  +0.0122 ? ? ? 18 Month Strip ?2.6173  -0.0024 ? ? | Month | High  |  Low  | Close | Change || MAR   | 2.150 | 2.095 | 2.138 | +0.058 || APR   | 2.205 | 2.150 | 2.190 | +0.043 || MAY   | 2.280 | 2.230 | 2.258 | +0.028 || JUN   | 2.345 | 2.310 | 2.326 | +0.016 || JUL   | 2.425 | 2.380 | 2.391 | +0.011 || AUG   | 2.485 | 2.430 | 2.448 | +0.008 || SEP   | 2.475 | 2.430 | 2.448 | +0.008 || OCT   | 2.495 | 2.455 | 2.472 | +0.006 || NOV   | 2.735 | 2.685 | 2.699 | +0.005 || DEC   | 2.945 | 2.904 | 2.904 | -0.005 || JAN   | 3.030 | 2.985 | 2.994 | -0.013 || FEB   | 2.980 | 2.940 | 2.947 | -0.018 |-------------------------------------------------------------Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River Project (SRP) and Sempra EnergyResources announce Open Season for proposed Desert Crossing Gas Storage andTransportation System.

The refinery is located in Richmond, about 10 miles from San Francisco. Chevron officials say the situation is now under control. The chemicals, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, can cause a burning and irritating sensation to the eyes, nose, throat and airways upon exposure at certain levels, prompting officials to warn residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed. Part of the plant is shutdown for maintenance, although some units are still operating. -------------------------------------------------------------??GET REAL about energy risk management with KWIIn today s fast moving energy markets you need to be able to manage risk in real time.That means knowing before you hit a risk problem, not afterwards when it may be too late to prevent big losses spreading right through your enterprise.With kW3000(tm), our multi-commodity, integrated front to back office software, you can monitor your Profit At Risk(tm), counterparty risk and mark-to-market all in real time.Keep alert to risk.

Occidental will become Lyondell s largest stockholder and will assume 2 seats on the Lyondell board. The deal will boost Lyondell s stake in Equistar to 70.5%. Millennium Chemicals owns the remaining 29.5%. Occidentals initial equity investment in Lyondell includes a purchase of about 34 million new Series B Lyondell shares that can be converted into common shares after 3 years. Lyondell will use the proceeds of that sale to buy Occidental s portion of Equistar. Occidental gained the stake upon adding its petrochemical business to the venture in 1998. Lyondell said the transactions would conserve cash and provide for acceleration of its debt repayment program. The financial details of the transactions were not disclosed. Lyondell said that while the deals will be cash-flow neutral and will dilute its earnings initially, they will be accretive to cash flow and earnings as the cyclical chemical business improves. With the additional cash, Lyondell is looking to pay off its $5.6 billion purchase of Arco Chemical in 1998. -------------------------------------------------------------IPE-Brent Crude futures (US $/barrel)Month ?First ?High ?Low ??Sett ?ChgMAR 02 18.95 19.22 18.75 19.18 +0.39 APR 02 19.15 19.42 18.96 19.41 +0.39 MAY 02 19.23 19.54 19.08 19.54 +0.41 JUN 02 19.17 19.48 19.03 19.48 +0.40 JUL 02 19.24 19.51 19.06 19.51 +0.39 AUG 02 19.29 19.56 19.17 19.56 +0.37 SEP 02 19.15 19.61 19.15 19.61 +0.36OCT 02 19.65 19.65 19.65 19.65 +0.35NOV 02 19.68 19.68 19.68 19.68 +0.34DEC 02 19.71 19.71 19.20 19.71 +0.33-------------------------------------------------------------NYMEX-Mont Belvieu Propane Gas Futures($ / Gallon)Month ? ?High ??Low ??Last ?

The 4th quarter average estimate of analysts was $0.47 per share. It also had operating revenue of $272.8 million compared to $225.9 million a year ago. Nobles international rigs fetched an average of $62,088 per day in the last quarter, 38% above year ago levels. Its Gulf of Mexico rig utilization fell to 65% from 100% a year ago, but Noble received $44,900 per rig on average during the quarter, a 1% increase over a year earlier. In addition, Noble said it would change its jurisdiction of incorporation to the Cayman Islands from Delaware as part of a corporate restructuring. The company will form Noble Corp, a subsidiary of Noble Drilling and the holding company of all the companies in the Noble group. Due to its significant exposure to the international markets, Noble said the new structure will give it greater flexibility operationally and financially. Stockholders must approve the move at the annual meeting in April.

The union said it would strike at 6 refineries, 2 in Texas and 4 in California, owned by ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, BP and Phillips. Combined, the plants have a production capacity of 1.2 million bpd, or about 9% of the nations oil refinery output. The refinery workers have been instructed to proceed with an orderly shutdown if no agreement or contract extension was in place by midnight last night, when the current contract expires. It would be the 1st strike at any US refineries since 1980. The union says that both parties are far apart on major issues and that picketing was a likelihood unless an agreement could be reached. Shell is the lead company negotiating with PACE officials and said it hoped for an agreement before the deadline. The oil companies are expected to keep the refineries running if a strike occurs, but would not say if production might be reduced. In the event of a strike, managers at the companies will run the refineries. Phillips said it would continue operating its California refineries with non-union personnel. Shell has offered a pay raise of $0.60 per hour for the contracts 1st year and annual raises of 3% and 3.5% after that. Shell s offer also called for a $0.75 per hour differential for the evening shift and $1.25 per hour for overnight shifts, $0.25 above the current contract in both cases. The union is bargaining for a pay hike of $1.40 per hour in the 1st year of the contract and subsequent annual raises of 6%. The union is also seeking an evening shift differential of 5% of the top pay grade at the worker s plant and 10% for overnight shifts. If the sides reach agreement, unions and oil companies will likely use it as a benchmark for oil workers contracts around the nation. US oil workers average earnings are about $23 per hour, or about $48,000 per year, excluding overtime. Under the union s proposal the 1st year average of the contract would rise to $25.79 an hour.  -------------------------------------------------------------ENERGY.@ENERGY(r), FEA s Complete Suite of Energy Products,BUILT FOR THE FUTURE.*Manage all your energy risks.*Build and Price deals.*Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.)*Report and reduce your energy risksFEAFINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES Inc.http://www.fea.com/?cId=17main phone number:? 1 510-548-6200email address: info@fea.com -------------------------------------------------------------PHYSICAL GAS PRICES? ? ?Gulf/Eastern Region     | Agua Dulce              | 2.00  || ANR SE                  | 2.10  || Carthage TG             | 2.09  || Chicago Citygate        | 2.17  || Columbia Gulf Onshore   | 2.10  || Dominion South Point    | 2.31  || Henry Hub               | 2.14  || Houston Ship Channel    | 2.17  || Katy Hub                | 2.11  || NGPL LA Pool            | 2.10  || NGPL - Midcontinent     | 2.06  || NGPL STX                | 2.06  || NGPL TX/OK              | 2.07  || NNG Demarc.             | 2.15  || Niagara                 | 2.29  || Sonat Tier 1            | 2.12  || TCO IPP Pool            | 2.25  || Tetco ELa               | 2.07  || Tetco M-3               | 2.37  || Tetco STX               | 2.01  || TGP Zone 0              | 2.04  || TGP Zone 1 (500 Leg)    | 2.08  || TGT Zone SL             | 2.10  || New York Citygate       | 2.40  || Transco Station 65      | 2.13  || Transco Zone 6 (NY)     | 2.41  || Trunk ELa               | 2.11  || Western Region          | California Border       | 2.18  || El Paso Keystone        | 2.06  || El Paso San Juan-Blanco | 2.07  || Waha Hub                | 2.08  || Canadian/Rockies Region | Nova/Aeco (C$/gig)      | 2.91  || Dawn Hub/Union          | 2.26  || Northwest Stanfield     | 2.06  || Wyoming Pool            | 1.94  || Opal                    | 1.94  || PGT-Malin               | 2.12  || Sumas                   | 2.02  |           Flow Date 2/1-------------------------------------------------------------ENERGY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTEHigher Education for refined product professionalsNOW ENROLLING RISK MANAGEMENT COURSES: PROFESSIONAL GASOLINE AND DISTILLATEMANAGEMENT, PETROLEUM MARKETER, and  ADVANCED GASOLINE AND DISTILLATE MASTERLEVEL.REGISTER NOW, CLASS SIZES ARE LIMITED.SEE COMPLETE DETAILS CLICK HERE :http://www.energyinstitution.org-------------------------------------------------------------EIA Says Refinery Run Cuts Build Crude Oil Stocks     Crude oil stocks built sharply last week as poor profit margins and ample supply of refined products forced refiners to slash runs, according to the EIA. The nation s refineries have slowed by 5.4% in the past two weeks, dropping to just 86.8% last week. Last week s refinery use figure is the lowest reported by the EIA since February 2000. Crude stocks built 2.1 million barrels last week as big refiners reduced runs to battle weak demand and poor margins. Earlier, the API showed crude supplies of 32.2 million barrels, or 11%, above last year. The EIA reported a 2.6 million barrel gasoline build, boosted by a 120,000 bpd increase in gasoline imports as supplies flowed in from Europe. Refinery run cuts are not decreasing gasoline supplies as much as other products, with gasoline production holding strong last week at 8.15 million bpd. Total US product demand is down 4.5% from a year ago, even though gasoline demand is 0.8% higher. Distillate fuel stocks dropped 200,000 barrels, a small fall at a time when winter heating demand normally draws down inventories rapidly. Mild temperatures in the Northeast meant that heating oil stocks actually rose 1.5 million barrels. Diesel fuel stocks fell 1.7 million barrels. -------------------------------------------------------------Energy ReleasesOpt in Email has 9 times the response of regular mail and costs less thanthe postage.

Industry sources had said Exxon Mobil planned to shutdown a crude distillation unit at the plant today for 4 weeks. The plant has shut a portion of its 35,000 bpd alkylation unit for work, but that the work has little effect on the refinery s output. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIA REPORT for           CHANGE from WEEK   CHANGE from WEEK WEEK ENDED 1/25/02         ENDED 1/18/02   ]  ENDED 1/25/01 CRUDE........ 316.9 MLN     UP   2.1 MLN      UP   24.7 MLN DISTILLATE... 138.8 MLN     DOWN 0.2 MLN      UP   20.6 MLN GASOLINE..... 216.7 MLN     UP   2.6 MLN      UP   13.3 MLN HEATING OIL..  59.5 MLN     UP   1.5 MLN      UP   10.2 MLN UTILIZATION..  86.8%        DOWN 2.9%         DOWN  5.1% PRODUCT DEMAND 19.1 MLN bpd DOWN 0.2 MLN bpd  DOWN  4.5% 4-WEEK AVERAGE --------------------------------------------------------------FINANCIAL SUMMARYThe TSE 300 gained 99.66 points to 7648.49The CRB Index climbed 0.36 points to 187.29The US Dollar increased 0.54 points to 120.16The Dow advanced 157.00 points to 9920.00The S&P 500 climbed 16.63 points to 1130.20The Nasdaq was up 20.59 points to 1934.03March NYMEX Crude Oil added 0.40 to 19.48Canadian-US Exchange rose 0.0009 to 1.5923-------------------------------------------------------------For information on  advertising on Enerfax GOlD or Enerfax Daily please write advertise@enerfax.com or call 800-809-8289-------------------------------------------------------------Past issues available on Divine s Sagewave.

While the API said crude supplies increased by 27,000 barrels, the API reported a much steeper 2.1 million barrel rise. The API said that gasoline inventories climbed by 2.74 million barrels and EIA data indicated a 2.6 million barrel increase. But the implied demand for gasoline remained unchanged. Distillate stocks fell by 200,000 barrels according to the EIA and by 150,000 barrels in API data. Implied demand for distillates dropped from 4.12 million barrels to 3.85 million barrels last week. The API said that refinery usage dropped to 85.8% from 89.4%, while the EIA pegged it at 86.8%. Traders are still watching OPEC and non-cartel producers who committed to cut almost 2 million bpd from supplies on January 1st. It may take a few more weeks before the reductions have an impact in the US and there have been conflicting reports of compliance by the producers. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.0114 to $0.5091 per gallon. February gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0138 to $0.5531 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were down $0.45 to $18.79 per barrel. -------------------------------------------------------------????????????????????NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures12 Month Strip ?2.5057 ? ? ? 18 Month Strip ?2.6197 ? ? | Month | High  |  Low  | Close | Change || MAR   | 2.115 | 2.030 | 2.080 | +0.013 || APR   | 2.180 | 2.100 | 2.147 | -0.003 || MAY   | 2.260 | 2.200 | 2.230 | -0.010 || JUN   | 2.340 | 2.290 | 2.310 | -0.010 || JUL   | 2.420 | 2.350 | 2.380 | -0.013 || AUG   | 2.465 | 2.410 | 2.440 | -0.013 || SEP   | 2.470 | 2.435 | 2.440 | -0.018 || OCT   | 2.490 | 2.450 | 2.466 | -0.022 || NOV   | 2.725 | 2.694 | 2.694 | -0.024 || DEC   | 2.940 | 2.900 | 2.909 | -0.024 || JAN   | 3.030 | 3.000 | 3.007 | -0.024 || FEB   | 3.010 | 2.965 | 2.965 | -0.026 |-------------------------------------------------------------Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River Project (SRP) and Sempra EnergyResources announce Open Season for proposed Desert Crossing Gas Storage andTransportation System.

The President s comments were directed at the Senate where energy legislation is currently stalled. During one-half of the  speech, the President spoke to economic issues facing the country and made specific inference that developing domestic resources for energy was a matter of both national security and economic recovery. Supporters of opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge say that the President s remarks are indicate that safe and responsible ANWR development could double the current domestic supply of oil and help stimulate the economy through job creation. The president made a strong statement in a bipartisan fashion that included support for domestic energy. The presence of  president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which supports the president s ANWR efforts, illustrated the importance President Bush places on ANWR and jobs. The president enhanced bipartisan support by demanding environmental protection. No areas in the US are equal to ANWR in their oil potential and environmental safeguards. The US Geological Survey reports that beneath the 1.5 million-acre tract in Alaska s Coastal Plain is upwards of 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The 2,000 acres of the ANWR designated for exploration could replace Iraqi imports for the next 70 years, create hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and help promote national security. -------------------------------------------------------------??GET REAL about energy risk management with KWIIn today s fast moving energy markets you need to be able to manage risk in real time.That means knowing before you hit a risk problem, not afterwards when it may be too late to prevent big losses spreading right through your enterprise.With kW3000(tm), our multi-commodity, integrated front to back office software, you can monitor your Profit At Risk(tm), counterparty risk and mark-to-market all in real time.Keep alert to risk.

The deal could be susceptible to intervention because Conoco shareholders would get little or no premium. Conoco investors will get 0.4677 of a share in the new company for each of their shares. Phillips investors will receive a one-on-one swap. A competing offer could lead to a bidding war, since oil and natural gas prices are depressed. It seems that Conoco could be an easier target for ChevronTexaco because a bid for Phillips large refining interests on the West Coast may raise antitrust concerns. Shell, which has been seeking to expand their natural gas assets in North America could also be interested in Conoco. Conoco increased its natural gas reserves and production by 50% through its acquisition of Gulf Canada Resources last July. But, acquisition of Phillips could be more attractive to TotalFinaElf and would present no antitrust difficulties because it has no oil refinery operations in the US. However, competing bidders could find themselves put off by a poison pill buried in the Phillips/Conoco deal. The companies included a $550 million breakup fee if either company terminates the deal. However, that can be overcome if both are bought. Also, Phillips and Conoco tied up the industry s top 6 advisers, reducing the number of potential advisers available to other bidders and providing themselves with some high powered ammunition to fight a hostile bid. -------------------------------------------------------------IPE-Brent Crude futures (US $/barrel)Month ?First ?High ?Low ??Sett ?ChgMAR 02 18.93 19.05 18.38 18.79 -0.45 APR 02 19.16 19.27 18.64 19.02 -0.43 MAY 02 19.29 19.37 18.75 19.13 -0.41 JUN 02 19.30 19.30 18.72 19.08 -0.37 JUL 02 19.29 19.29 18.79 19.12 -0.34 AUG 02 19.28 19.28 19.06 19.19 -0.30 SEP 02 19.15 19.25 19.00 19.25 -0.27OCT 02 19.30 19.30 19.30 19.30 -0.25NOV 02 19.34 19.34 19.34 19.34 -0.24DEC 02 19.48 19.48 19.08 19.38 -0.23-------------------------------------------------------------NYMEX-Mont Belvieu Propane Gas Futures($ / Gallon)Month ? ?High ??Low ??Last ?

Mild weather will persist throughout much of Europe and China s weather will be cold over the next week or so. A big increase in the heating fuel demand will continue to be seen through the week across the western portions of the US as a cold air mass from Canada moves southeastward. The eastern part of the nation will see warmer than usual weather causing the heating demand to remain lower than normal. Canada s coldest air mass of the season will shift from the western provinces into Ontario and Quebec this week. The demand for heating oil will jump as the frigid temperatures replace mild weather in the east. Chilly temperatures will continue in the west maintaining steady heating demand usage, but warmer weather is expected for northern British Columbia and Alberta. In Europe, temperatures 5? - 9? above normal continue through next week resulting in below normal heating fuel demand across much of the continent. The warmer temperatures will shift into the far eastern countries of the region allowing near-normal temperatures to return to the western countries by the end of next week. In China, wintry weather will continue to track across much of the country as relatively cold temperatures persist in the west central regions of the continent, boosting heating fuel consumption. Japanese temperatures are expected to average 2? - 4 ? degrees below normal during the next 10 days with heating fuel consumption expected to be slightly above normal. -------------------------------------------------------------IPE - ARA Gas Oil Futures $ / TonneMonth ??High ??Low ???Sett ?Change FEB 02 160.00 155.00 155.75 - 5.75 MAR 02 160.50 155.50 156.50 - 5.50 APR 02 162.00 157.50 158.25 - 5.25 MAY 02 162.75 159.75 159.75 - 5.75 JUN 02 165.25 161.75 162.00 - 5.25 JUL 02 164.00 164.00 164.00 - 5.00 AUG 02 169.25 166.00 166.00 - 5.00SEP 02 170.50 167.50 168.00 - 5.00OCT 02 173.00 170.00 170.00 - 5.00NOV 02 174.25 171.25 171.25 - 5.00-------------------------------------------------------------NY HARBOR UNLEADED GAS FUTURESMonth? ?High ?

Petro-Canada aims to vastly expand its international exploration and production profile by buying the assets of Germany s Veba from BP. The assets are located in the North Sea, North Africa and South America. The cash deal will boost Petro-Canada s reserves and production by more than 70% and add to earnings and cash flow per share. But it will also increase debt to 2.1 times last year s cash flow. Weakening commodity prices mean cash flow this year could be lower, exasperating the problem. Shares in Petro-Canada sank C$1.58, or more than 4%, to C$35.30 yesterday. Veba s assets are located in a dozen countries. -------------------------------------------------------------ENERGY.@ENERGY(r), FEA s Complete Suite of Energy Products,BUILT FOR THE FUTURE.*Manage all your energy risks.*Build and Price deals.*Value physical assets (generation, storage, etc.)*Report and reduce your energy risksFEAFINANCIAL ENGINEERING ASSOCIATES Inc.http://www.fea.com/?cId=17main phone number:? 1 510-548-6200email address: info@fea.com -------------------------------------------------------------PHYSICAL GAS PRICES? ? ?Gulf/Eastern Region     | Agua Dulce              | 1.97  || ANR SE                  | 2.06  || Carthage TG             | 2.05  || Chicago Citygate        | 2.12  || Columbia Gulf Onshore   | 2.06  || Dominion South Point    | 2.20  || Henry Hub               | 2.07  || Houston Ship Channel    | 2.12  || Katy Hub                | 2.06  || NGPL LA Pool            | 2.03  || NGPL - Midcontinent     | 2.01  || NGPL STX                | 2.00  || NGPL TX/OK              | 2.03  || NNG Demarc.             | 2.09  || Niagara                 | 2.30  || Sonat Tier 1            | 2.05  || TCO IPP Pool            | 2.15  || Tetco ELa               | 2.05  || Tetco M-3               | 2.38  || Tetco STX               | 1.98  || TGP Zone 0              | 2.01  || TGP Zone 1 (500 Leg)    | 2.05  || TGT Zone SL             | 2.06  || New York Citygate       | 2.39  || Transco Station 65      | 2.13  || Transco Zone 6 (NY)     | 2.40  || Trunk ELa               | 2.07  || Western Region          | California Border       | 2.17  || El Paso Keystone        | 2.05  || El Paso San Juan-Blanco | 2.05  || Waha Hub                | 2.05  || Canadian/Rockies Region | Nova/Aeco (C$/gig)      | 2.93  || Dawn Hub/Union          | 2.24  || Northwest Stanfield     | 2.06  || Wyoming Pool            | 1.95  || Opal                    | 1.97  || PGT-Malin               | 2.13  || Sumas                   | 2.06  |          Flow Date 1/31-------------------------------------------------------------ENERGY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTEHigher Education for refined product professionalsNOW ENROLLING RISK MANAGEMENT COURSES: PROFESSIONAL GASOLINE AND DISTILLATEMANAGEMENT, PETROLEUM MARKETER, and  ADVANCED GASOLINE AND DISTILLATE MASTERLEVEL.REGISTER NOW, CLASS SIZES ARE LIMITED.SEE COMPLETE DETAILS CLICK HERE :http://www.energyinstitution.org-------------------------------------------------------------Iran s Petroleum Minister Says Cut Unnecessary    Iran sees no reason for OPEC to cut oil production at its meeting in March, according to its petroleum minister. His comments came as OPEC s general secretary forecast that oil producing nations would again begin cooperating on pricing. Several OPEC members were Athens attending an energy sector conference. Russia says it will apply the same criteria it used when it last decided to cut oil production, including an appraisal of the international oil situation. Russia disappointed OPEC last year when asked it to cut output to keep up prices. Russia initially offered a cut of just 30,000 bpd, and only after intensive lobbying by OPEC officials offered to increase its cut to 150,000 bpd. OPEC says the economic fallout from the September 11th attacks would only have short to medium term effect on oil prices. It forecasts world oil demand reaching around 106 million bpd by 2020 compared with 76 million bpd now. By 2020, OPEC says it will be producing 53 million bpd, or a market share of about 50%. -------------------------------------------------------------Energy ReleasesOpt in Email has 9 times the response of regular mail and costs less thanthe postage.

At the UN conference in the Hague, environmental groups are accusing  the US of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution. The  conference opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released  into the atmosphere. One major issue revolved around how much  countries could trade off against their commitments to roll back  their own pollution by helping other countries reduce theirs or by  planting new forests to absorb greenhouse gases. The US advocates  unlimited emissions trading, but the EU and some developing  countries fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest  polluters to change their ways. The US argues that emissions trading  is the most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing  greenhouse gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels, and would give time for  the transition to cleaner energy and expensive new technologies.  About 6,000 bureaucrats, scientists, environmentalists and  businessmen attended the opening. That number was expected to grow  to 10,000 during the second week with the arrival of 100 government  ministers for the culmination of negotiations. Months of talks have  preceded the conference. Three years ago at Kyoto, governments drew  up targets for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases but  could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by  8%, the US by 7% and Japan by 6%. Each was allowed to decide how it  would make the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have  ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized  country on the list, and none is among the heaviest polluting  countries. The agreement needs the ratification of 55 countries,  representing at least 55% of the harmful emissions, before it will  come into force. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[IMAGE]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnerfax  Daily? -?

He may be a risky start in Week 11.Steve McNair <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01The Tennessean says McNair s hand was sore when he arrived at the team s practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn t expect him to miss any practice time this week. Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday s game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday s game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can t play.Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday s game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can t play.Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.! sp! ortsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday s game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup. Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12363&> , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That s kind of hypothetical,   he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we re going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.  Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday s game against the Cowboys. \"We ll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,\" Shanahan told the Denver Post. \"If he can help our football team, he ll play. If he s in a situation where he can t perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, then we ll keep him out and put somebody else in.\" Benjamin Gay <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won t indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. \"We ll try to get him involved in some of the games,\" Davis said. \"We ll see.\" Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday s game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn t been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the  Skins. Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He s been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable. Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend s game against Carolina. The injuries aren t considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis. Cecil Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133349&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday s game against Dallas. He ll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend s game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Giants <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=19&>, DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn s surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he d be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team s starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133276&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday s game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Ravens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=3&>, DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He ll help keep Denver s running game in check, but don t expect his presence to give Dallas  defense added Fantasy value as a whole. Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&r! an! dom=4658&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01Smith (knee) will start on Thursday s game against Denver. \"I m not 100 percent, but I m healthy enough to do my job,\" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He ll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas  horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday s game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he s expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.! Terry Hardy <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego. Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Harris is out for Thursday s game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.

He won t get enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration, so avoid using him. Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/02/01Pittman has been cleared to play this weekend against Philadelphia. \"Pitt practiced (Friday), he s fine, he s going to play,\" Head Coach Dave McGinnis repor! te! d. With Pittman playing, it looks as though Thomas Jones will play a lesser role than what was earlier reported. Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/02/01Huntley is expected to start this week against Miami, but he s not worth considering as a starter for your Fantasy team. Huntley will struggle against Miami s tough defense, and the possibility for bad weather in South Florida makes him an even bigger gamble. Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/02/01Weinke has thrown five interceptions in his last two games, and has almost dropped completely off the Fantasy Football map. He s no better than a reserve at this point, so don t bother starting him against Miami. Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/02/01Jackson won t post excellent yardage numbers this week, but still may find the end zone. The Saints will depend on the run against the Jets, yet they may look to Jackson on play-action fakes and in the red zone.Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Walls is a must-! st! art this weekend against Miami. He leads all NFC tight ends in receptions and is one of the more reliable Fantasy players in the league at his position. Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/02/01Williams should have an excellent outing this week. Expect him to rip major holes in the Jets  weak run defense throughout the game.Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/02/01Muhammad has struggled in recent weeks, and facing a tough Miami secondary won t help his cause. He may be a top-notch Fantasy wideout, but it may be a wise move to reserve him this week if at all possible. Dez White <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01White remains a risky start each week. While his overall numbers have improved, he is still dropping passes, and may eventually lose the No. 2 receiver job to David Terrell.Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 11/02/01Smith has been adequate at best since taking over for the in! ju! red Jamal Anderson in Atlanta. New England has been suspect against the run this season, so don t be surprised to see Smith score a rushing touchdown and compile 80-plus yards on the ground this week. Marty Booker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Booker may not post great yardage numbers against the Browns, but the Bears should be able to spread the field and give him the opportunity to catch at least one TD pass.Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Chandler has been an adequate starting quarterback for Fantasy owners this season, connecting on nine touchdown passes in five games. Unless you have a signal-caller with a better matchup, starting Chandler is a good move. Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/02/01Mathis has been very unreliable this season, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a real gamble. He ll be facing Patriots  CB Ty Law this weekend, so try to avoid using him if possible. Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/02/01Morton should post good number! s ! against the 49ers this week. San Francisco s pass defense has been inconsistent, and the Lions may play from behind and pass the ball often.Kevan Barlow <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/02/01Barlow hasn t done much over the last few weeks, but he may find some success this weekend against the Lions  terrible run defense. If you re desperate for a tailback this week, Barlow may be a solid option. Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/02/01Hearst could be in for a big game against Detroit this weekend. The Lions are allowing an average of 147.2 yards rushing per game, so be sure to start Hearst this weekend based on the matchup. Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/02/01Owens could have a huge game on Sunday lining up against the Lions  depleted secondary. Owens is one of the league s top wideouts and worth starting on a weekly basis. Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Franks did not catch a TD pass in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. H! e ! has been a regular TD threat for the rest of the season, so don t bench him in any week.J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 11/02/01Stokes has been horrible this season, so starting him in any week is a serious risk. At this point, Stokes isn t even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. Antonio Freeman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 11/02/01Freeman caught only one pass for six yards in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. He may disappoint again this week, because No. 2 WR Bill Schroeder is not expected to play.! Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/02/01Green totaled 124 total yards from scrimmage in his first meeting with the Buccaneers this year. Expect him to be a key receiver again for Brett Favre this week, especially with No. 2 WR Bill Schroeder ailing. Favre may need Green to bail him out if Antonio Freeman is double-covered downfield.Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/02/01Favre threw only one TD pass and was intercepted three times in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. Expect slightly better numbers from him at home against the Buccaneer! s ! this week. Favre may throw more than one TD pass, but expect at least one interception as well.Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Harris has done nothing this season, and isn t even worth a roster spot at this point. Unless you play in a very deep league, the Dallas tight end should be left on the waiver wire. Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Ismail has been an unproductive Fantasy player for most of the season, so starting him in any week in not advisable. In fact, \"the Rocket\" is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues at this point. Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Westbrook finally had a productive game last weekend against the Giants, catching two passes for 83 yards and a score. His luck won t be as good this week against Seattle CB Shawn Springs, so avoid starting outside of deeper leagues. Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01Gardner has emerged as Washington s No. 1 receiving option, and is worth starting this weekend against Seattle. The Seahawks  secondary has been average this season, and facing CB Willie Williams shouldn t present much of a challenge to the talented rookie. Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/02/01Dayne has been very inconsistent this season, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. Dallas has been surprisingly tough against the run, which makes Dayne worth starting in deeper leagues only. Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/02/01Barber has had some success in the past against Dallas, so don t be surprised if he scores a TD this week. He won t put up huge yardage numbers, however, so start him based on the type of league you re involved in. Kerry Collins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1013&>, QB NYG - Russell Updated 11/02/01Collins finally had a big game last weekend against Washington, but he s still been very inconsistent overall. He s had moderate success against Dallas in the past, and is only worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues.

        "body": "Dear Market Participant,In the interest of not flooding the webmaster with constant changes (newPTIDs or new participant names) to theUCAP forms (Certification, Bid Forms, and Offer Forms), I will be updatingthe forms about once per month.  Since you willneed a methodology to work around missing information, the new forms havecodes that will allow you to enterundefined PTIDs and undefined new participants.PTID number 999999 is used for a resource that has not been assigned anumber.NewLSE is used for a new Load Serving Entity that has not been assigned a\"Registrant Name\"NewSuppl is used for a new Supplier that has not been assigned a\"Registrant Name\"NOTE that if you use any of the above, you must describe your intentions inthe comments cell of the form being submitted.Other ChangesISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result ofNYISO transactions during the supplementalprocess.  The supplemental process is implemented when there isinsufficient UCAP available within a location andthe NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortagehas occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISOauction have been assigned.  The PTIDnumbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplementalprocesses.   For example, a participant who isselling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auctionwould enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form whenselling into a subsequent ISO auction.A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of theauction Offer forms.ReminderWhen identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think interms of the procurement period for the first auctionmonth when the transaction took place.  For example, on May 15 (the auctionfor the upcoming months of June through October)3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.  The auctionreference that you will use for both the June andAugust transactions are ISOMoJun.  The same auction reference would be usedif on May 15, the transactions were forAugust and September.When completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.  Lets saythat you are awarded 25 MW from the StripAuction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.  Yourentries on the form would show the 25 MW stripauction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MWbilateral transaction.  You can not use avalue of 20MW on one line.Each and Every Month you must submit your certification form.Regards,Bob Boyle(See attached file: Certification Form 9-27-01_20_00.xls)(See attachedfile: Winter_icap_auction_monthly_bid_form_09-27-01_19_30.xls)(See attachedfile: Winter_icap_auction_monthly_offer_form_09-27-01_20_00.xls) - Certification Form 9-27-01_20_00.xls  - Winter_icap_auction_monthly_bid_form_09-27-01_19_30.xls  - Winter_icap_auction_monthly_offer_form_09-27-01_20_00.xls",

Frogger, that old traffic dodger, has seen a recent res=urgence on the Game Boy Advance and other platforms, while Sega spokesmasco=t Sonic the Hedgehog is soon to debut on both the GameCube and the GBA in t=wo games that work cooperatively. Other characters who ve made recent comeb=acks include Pac-Man, Pitfall Harry <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN=/B00005BJ9C/ref=3Dmk_del_248439_22>, and the vampire hunters of Castlevania= <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005BJ9G/ref=3Dmk_del_248439_23>=.

The rookie RB is tal=ented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ro=n Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six t=imes for 26 yards against Oakland. Don t depend on him for good numbers dur=ing the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 11=/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught fiv=e passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners wou=ld still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomli=nson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zon=e, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback h=ad 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego s 20-17 loss.=   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, =throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he s on=ly worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB= ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01! Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, =posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also thre=w two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston =, WR ARI - BCWD s Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, cat=ching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He s one =of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting= on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/25/01 =Jackson had a! g! ood outing against New England, catching five catches for= 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiv=er, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurric=anes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes f=or 97 yards against New England. He s been a very dependable receiver in re=cent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=AK - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley ca=rried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often i=n short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting =for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he =may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Sm=ith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense= and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=me a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -= God Updated 11/25/01! Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posti=ng 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He s become a pretty reliable Fan=tasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patri=ots  bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD s Updated 11/25/0=1 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Gi=ants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the mos=t reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Upd=ated 11/25/01  Sanders left Sunday s game against San Diego after re-aggrav=ating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not re=turn to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Moulds= finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards =and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should= still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year.= Don t be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medioc=re performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van P=elt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interc=eption. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he =remains in Buffalo s starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Up=dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did= not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable =to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle=r , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three =TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk =of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependab=le Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 11/25/01 Th=e Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TD=s or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such= a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 11/25/=01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington! . ! He is too= inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs appro=ach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught fo=ur passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considera=bly in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy hom=estretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter sa=w extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems.= He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in= on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries=.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place =of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers =in Muhammad s absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina s 10-7= loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/25/01 Muh=ammad missed ! Su! nday s game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. Hi=s status for next weekend s game against New Orleans is unknown at this tim=e.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught =two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open of=ten, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays =healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a= subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The F=alcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reaso=n for Chandler s poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G mone=y Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return f=rom a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a= Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

But the Ch=iefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , =TE IND - God Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapo=lis passing game anymore. Don t expect much from him against the underrated= New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Agent Upda=ted 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis  top option at tight end. H=e will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England t=his week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Beegs Boys Updated 10/18/01 James was =held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this ye=ar. Expect much better numbers on James  home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne= , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in plac!= e ! of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne ha=s not done much yet, so don t put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harr=ison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs we=ll in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. E=xpect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB= IND - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time= he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but =should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN =- G money Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday d=ue to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and p=lay Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him u=ntil it s clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - =Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle =injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his p=rogress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE =- Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week.= Indianapolis  secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately= proved an early-season layoff didn t hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith ,= RB NE - Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the= first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone= at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne C=hrebet , WR NYJ - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet s numbers have been ve=ry disappointing so far. He could have a good week! i! f the Jets engage in= a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will= center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Pe=rrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the =Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs shou=ld be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Kar Bomb=s Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense t=his week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the R=ams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his f=irst decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he s still a v=ery risky Fantasy player due to Washington s horrible offense. Facing Carol=ina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warran=ts consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks= was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 pass=es for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn t even wo=rth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS -= El-Gato Update! d ! 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this se=ason, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He s had some suc=cess against the Panthers in the past, but he s still only worth starting i=n deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - BCWD s Updated 10/18/01 Tes=taverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be o=pportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first intercep=tion of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasb=y will likely get most of the work at tight end no! w ! that Stephen Alexan=der is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this poin=t.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have =a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He s wor=th considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Tor=ry Holt , WR STL - Oper Error Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to po=st big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He s a big ti=me Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.=   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn t been very c=onsistent thus far, but he s far too talented to ever consider benching. Lo=ok for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets seconda=ry.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Tacos Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a =decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He s worth staring= on a weekly basis if you don t have a more reliable tight end on your rost=er.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Canidate wi!= ll! likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis  featured back this weekend= against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams  offense and is= easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner =, QB STL - Hurricanes Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts= up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He ll post =another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him= your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Buck=halter isn t expected to start, but don t be surprised if he gets the major=ity of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will= start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more= productiv! e ! of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style= Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, a=nd is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two s=cores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your= lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is =slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb s favorite targets this season. He s =worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this= point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-C=osta Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligamen=t in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to fo=ur weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaw=are of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Hurricanes Updated= 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbe=rs on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He s one of the league s top tight en=ds and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.
