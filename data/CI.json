        "body": "As you are probably aware, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject instituting retail rate caps in San Diego and instead adopted SDG&E s proposal to refund over $100 million.  The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E s motion to enter into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX using the bilateral-option market.  These transactions will be confidential and will be disclosed only to the Commission s energy division, for purposes of reasonableness.  The Commission did not act upon San Diego s advice letter (#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives.  That advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in September.The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its costs to the customers.  It will also address whether SDG&E should be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX purchases.  It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange.  This is a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next week.Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the key legislative offices.  There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 Implementation Group).  From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants (generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego s consumers feel, extend the rate freeze, etc.  Although, most of the other legislative offices saw this proposal as a total morass.The legislative offices that we met with, while interested in providing some political cover to DeDe Alpert (Senator from San Diego in a close political race), were not interested in pursuing sweeping changes to the current structure, although this could change.  However, it should be noted that DeDe Alpert said herself that she would introduce rate cap legislation in San Diego when the legislature reconvenes on August 7.  Most of the discussion with the other offices was on what can be done by next summer and focused on bringing on peaking plants and expanding demand responsive programs.Sandi and Dave Parquet also met with John Stevens, of the Governor s Office.  He stated that the Governor did not want any major changes to the current structure to come across his desk, but that the Governor needed our help in preventing such changes from getting there, otherwise he may be politically compelled to sign the legislation.  Sandi will send out more information later, she s having computer problems.There will be a hearing next week of the Senate and Assembly Energy Committees on San Diego issues on August 10.We, in GA, will keep you updated on developments.",

The resultant rolling \"brown outs\" and the potential for blackouts in thefuture could have a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production inCalifornia and even in the national statistics. Indeed, the impact is likely to be greatest in thehighest value-added sectors: computers and computer components, two industries thathave been a key engine of U.S. growth. Not only that, electricity generation is an important proxy in the FederalReserve s estimation of industrial production. So, the measurement of statisticscould be directly affected. About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial productionindex is compiled on the basis of actual output volumes - tons of steel, boardfeetof lumber, or millions of autos assembled, etc. For other forms of output, accounting forabout a quarter of the index, contributions to total production are estimated basedon hours worked data, with the implicit assumption that productivity - or the rateof real output per labor hour - doesn t change much over short periods of time in theseindustries. But the remainder of the index, about 26% according to a Fed economist, isestimated using electricity generation measures. For this purpose, electricity generation is itself estimated from measuresof electric power usage by industry. Here, as with productivity, the technicalcoefficient, or the amount of electricity input per unit of output, is assumed to be constantover relatively long periods.         As Usual, Things Are Different In California California power companies, as part of the deregulation of the electricpower industry, offer their business customers \"interruptible rate plans\". That means thatfor a discounted rate, customers \"voluntarily\" allow the power company tointerrupt their power supply in times of peak demand. Too bad. The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has,in fact, resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California. And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both astatistical and real impact on production: the San Francisco earthquake of October 1989. That quake disrupted electricity generation, particularly south of the cityin Silicon Valley. Largely as a result of that disruption, national industrialproduction declined by 0.5% (0.6% in manufacturing) in October 1989. The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley andelsewhere in the state are very heavy users of electricity. It is reasonable to expect thattheir total consumption of electricity, and their output, have skyrocketed since 1989. This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy. First, chips are essential inputs to the production of other industriesfrom \"smart chips\" in cars to central processing units for computers. Thus, a bottleneck inchip supplies because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyondCalifornia. Second, chip production is among the highest value-added activities in theU.S. economy - each stage of production adds significantly to the value of totaloutput. This means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatlymagnified effect on overall economic activity. The usage is not confined to chip production, however. An extensive rangeof other California-based industries - from chemicals to textiles - have intensiveelectricity usage in their production. Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction inelectricity. And in fact, real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input. Ironically, these interruptions could complement the Fed s efforts to sloweconomic activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases. Whatinfuriates Californians might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us.    -By John McAuley, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-4425    john.mcauley@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

        "body": "Producers Indicate North Slope s Beaufort Route May Get Nod In what would be a major blow to Alaska officials, especially Gov. Tony Knowles who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, major producers indicated this week that because the cost would be less, they now favor a North Slope pipeline that would move north, through the Beaufort Sea, instead of across the state. Ken Konrad, a BP executive, testifying during two days of hearings before the Alaska legislature s Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, told the committee that an analysis \"so far indicates that the northern route appears more cost efficient than a southern route.\" Konrad also noted that with a Beaufort line, gas reserves in the Mackenzie River delta also could be taken -- which would be a major victory for Canadian officials. Konrad and other stakeholders, including producers, analysts and government officials involved in moving gas from the North Slope, were asked to speak before the joint committee and offer their insight on where the project could be headed.  BP and partners Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum, the majority property rights  holders on the North Slope, have been analyzing various routes for a proposed pipe since last fall, which basically would either move supply across the state or go north under the Beaufort Sea and into Canada on a trek toward the Lower 48. The producer consortium, the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group, is spending close to $100 million to evaluate the routes and has indicated it could file an application on one of the routes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the end of this year. Konrad s testimony, as well as comments made during the hearings, indicate that the desire of Alaska officials to keep the pipe inside the state may fall apart. What appears to be the deal maker or breaker is cost. Konrad said only \"a few dimes\" separate the two major proposals, but transportation costs per thousand Btus would pick up savings in lower investment costs with a shorter pipe and lower operating costs. Economists have estimated the rate for bringing gas to the Lower 48 from the North Slope will be around $2.25/MMBtu. A shorter pipe overall would lead to substantial savings, especially on a project that Konrad noted faces serious challenges economically. Joe Maruschack, Phillips  natural gas pipeline chief, said his group is aware of the \"deep reservations\" Alaskan officials have about a Beaufort route, but also indicated that problems associated with the Beaufort route could be risky as well. He cited environmental opposition from aboriginal groups, which would have to approve the routing, construction on a sea route, logistical challenges and additional permitting as part of a daunting, and lengthy task. If the consortium and other producers chose the Beaufort route, Maruschack indicated that they could explore some way to bring gas to Alaska s residents south of the North Slope. But in Alaska, it s about more than the supply. This past spring the Alaska legislature, with strong support from Knowles, passed a law to prevent construction of a Beaufort route (see Daily GPI, March 30 <d20010330d.html>). Without Alaska s support, the Beaufort route could also face defeat. \"We re coming to a divergence,\" said Harold Heinze, the former Alaska Natural Resources Department commissioner and a former energy executive. \"There s a big difference between maximizing the profitability of companies and maximizing the benefit to the state.\" Ken Thompson, a former Atlantic Richfield executive and president of Arco Alaska Inc., said one compromise would be to offer tax breaks for building along the Alaska Highway. \"They could pressure the governor and the legislature to make a deal,\" he told the committee. Roger Marks, a State of Alaska oil and gas economist who has studied the proposed projects, said the cost savings could be as much as $2 billion using the Beaufort route, which would be about 200 miles shorter than an Alaska Highway route. Total construction costs, according to Konrad, now range between $15 billion and $20 billion. \"Several dimes from your transportation costs could remove a lot of risks,\" Marks told the committee. Meanwhile, Alaska remains committed to getting a pipe through the state. Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska Inc. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the state on Thursday to complete its review of the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co. s previously filed right-of-way lease application to construct and operate the highway pipe. Foothills constructed what exists so far of the Alaska gas line and remains a proponent of the trans-Alaska route. U.S. and Canadian law has designated the ANNGTC, a partnership of Foothills and TransCanada PipeLines, to construct and operate the Alaska portion. Foothills and its affiliates would construct and operate the Canadian portion. \"This agreement is an important step in completing our land position for this project,\" said John Ellwood, Foothills vice president. \"Together with 400 miles of right-of-way we have on federal lands in Alaska and our extensive right-of-way in Canada, we are in an excellent position to expedite the building of the pipe.\" Ellwood said the application review, together with the existing permits and FERC and National Energy Board of Canada certificates, underlines the timing advantage of a trans-Alaska route advocated by Foothills and its shareholder companies, Westcoast Energy and TransCanada. \"One thing that everyone in Washington (DC) and Anchorage agree on is that getting North Slope gas to the Lower 48 is a priority, and our approved route along the Alaska Highway through Canada can deliver that gas two-to-three years earlier than any greenfield project,\" Ellwood said. \"We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to advance this project and that has enhanced our ability to deliver Alaska gas to the Lower 48.\"",

        "body": "Foothills CEOs Says Canada to Gain With Alaska Pipe Canadians are being assured by their two biggest natural gas transporters that they don t have to take sides in the contest over the northern pipelines because they stand to gain no matter which project wins. After carrying an estimated C$40 billion worth (US$27 billion) of exports to the United States in the past 20 years, the \"prebuild\" of the Alaska pipeline, completed by Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., predicts that far from losing, Canadians stand to gain if the country can build the missing northern link in the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS). Permanent benefits for all Canadian users of the pipeline grid are projected by Foothills co-CEOs Michael Stewart and Dennis McConaghy. Stewart is executive vice-president for business development for Westcoast Energy Inc. and McConaghy is his counterpart at TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. Foothills remains the sole owner of ANGTS s sponsor, Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., after nine U.S. partners in the original 1970s version of the project dropped out during its long dormant spell. In an interview, Stewart called Foothills a pipeline counterpart to \"the little engine that could,\" referring to the old children s story book. \"Except it s not so little,\" he said. Initially installed as an early start on southern legs in the mega-project in order to help finance the far costlier northern section, Foothills now carries about 35% of Canadian gas exports. Stewart described the reviving prospects of completing ANGTS as a further service -- this time in \"optimizing\" use of the Canadian pipeline grid. McConaghy believes that by completing the missing northern link, Canada would benefit, and Foothills has taken that case to the National Energy Board (NEB). The arrival of Alaskan gas into the 3.3 Bcf/d Foothills system would allow Canadian production to move over to TransCanada and Westcoast without forcing them to fight the new Alliance Pipeline and associated eastern links, the Vector and proposed Millennium systems. As a result,Canadians would shed the burden of costs associated with excess capacity that has emerged as a result of aggressive pipeline construction since the mid-1990s. Capacity grew so much that Natural Resources Canada estimates refilling the routes to the Lower 48 will require exports from the western provinces of about 3.8 Tcf/year - - or nearly one-third more than early-1990s industry planners estimated the region s gas fields could support on a sustained basis. Despite production increases generated by a record drilling pace over the past year, McConaghy estimated that the pipeline grid still has 1.5-2 Bcf of excess daily capacity. That poses a problem of \"defraying fixed costs,\" in his words. The problem drives an application by TransCanada to the NEB for a raise in its effective rate of return to 12.5% from 9.6%. The hike is sought to cover costs of lost traffic and compensate for increased business risks posed by the glutted, competitive Canadian market for gas-transportation services. Potentially long, hard-fought hearings are planned into how much of a raise to allow and how to translate it into toll increases for shippers still bound to use TransCanada by long delivery contracts. TransCanada has told the NEB it does not expect the cost pressure to end any time soon, if ever. At current gas discovery, sales and reserves depletion rates, TransCanada projects that the production capability of the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is liable to peak and slip into decline within eight to 13 years. Some of the strain is expected to originate within the Canadian petroleum industry as it turns increasingly for its oil supplies to heavy crude and the oil sands, employing gas-fired heat extraction processes. Use of gas by oil sands mining complexes is projected to triple by 2010 to 590 MMcf/d from 190 MMcf/d. Gas use by heavy-oil operations is expected to grow almost as fast, to 730 MMcf/d in 2010 from 270 MMcf/d. Gas-fired power generation in western Canada, which is also associated with industrial expansion, is forecast to consume 980 MMcf/d by 2010, compared to 490 MMcf/d last year. When will Alaskan gas arrive to take some of the pressure off western Canadian supplies? Foothills estimates it will take five years from the time when a decision is made to go ahead on building the northern connection. That includes two years of planning, securing transportation contracts, procuring materials and satisfying regulatory and environmental requirements, followed by three years of construction. Stewart and McConaghy are not predicting when the decision to go ahead will be made, although they are continuing to advance the mega-project through preliminaries such as nailing down rights-of-way. The Foothills CEOs expect no more than hints to emerge about when the talk about the northern revival will turn into action from hearings in Anchorage, before a natural gas pipelines committee set up by the Alaska State Legislature July 17 and 18.They expect a key element -- a plan by the owners of Prudhoe Bay gas, BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum -- to take much longer to come together. Current schedules for their feasibility studies indicate it will take until the end of the year for the reports to be completed, then as much as six months longer for corporate decisions on whether to proceed to development, with BP and Exxon Mobil making comparisons between Alaskan prospects and the rest of their global inventories of projects. Foothills suggests that the northern planning exercise is evolving into a \"two-pipeline world\" and reports that it is going beyond its ANGTS interests to try to get in on proposals for a Mackenzie Valley line. Stewart and McConaghy expect markets for gas and transportation capacity to decide which line to build when, although they add that governments can make a big difference with decisions on items such as passing on delivery costs to consumers. The Foothills executives predict Canada will honor the treaty that created ANGTS if the Alaskan project is revived.",

(NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world s largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation s largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.",

After the agencies are selected, a meetingshould be scheduled with those key agencies with the purpose ofobtaining their commitment to participate in the early collaborationwith the FERC on the Sun Devil Pipeline Project.  Your thoughts?---We shoulddefinitely meet with the federal land managing agencies as well as theNative Americans.  Better to meet with them individually at this point toassess their interest and willingness to work in an informal collaborativeprocess and ID major issues with the route.  We should also meet with theCOE, FWS and major state agencies to assess the same information.I also would like your input into the composition of the \"team\" thatrequests those meetings and participates.  I view the make-up of theteam players for this task as very important to get this projectoff-the-ground with the right momentum.  (Caveat: I am thinking that youand I (both) should play a dual lead role in these early meetings withLarry Campbell and/or Scott Patti setting them up for us - yourthoughts?) Then we can speak first hand to the FERC Staff about thecommitment to collaborate.  Don t you believe we need to obtain theircommitment prior to meeting with the FERC to discuss being consideredfor the expedited processing?---Yes, FERC requires knowing if the agencieswill be willing to participate in this process.  As for team makeup,Environmental, Business Development, and Engineering/Design should attendthese meetings to discuss FERC process and SunDevil s envi. approach to theproject, need for the project, and routing/design process that will beundertaken to make the project safe.  You and I don t both have to be ateach meeting, but since there will be multiple meetings, we could staffdependent upon schedules and availability.By the way, as \"food for thought\" I have received a note from Doug Lake(NRG) and he stands ready to do the Third Party contractor work on theEIS (if we can get the FERC to agree to let NRG do it without biddingthe job out).  In fact, since NRG has completed their work on the KernRiver loop project - Doug said that he has a team that could be placedon this project about the time we will need them.  That may work outgood for everyone, since the NRG team is familiar with the expeditedprocess, located in the western United States, and familiar with theagencies and contacts in the area of our project.  --NRG would have to convince not only FERC, but Enron they have theresources to complete the work in your aggressive schedule.  This is fairlycritical as you want a consultant who can \"keep up\" in this process and notput a lot of road blocks up.  On Gulfstream, NRGs monitors (representingFERC) are bringing up issues and trying to make issues with things that theFERC PM doesn t even think is worth doing---so we don t want someone doingthings that is right in their own eyes and not looking out for Enron s bestinterests.John Shafer-----Original Message-----From: Patti, Scott [mailto:SPatti@ensr.com]Sent: Thursday, September 20, 2001 4:49 PMTo: Shafer, John; Hyatt, Kevin; Gadd, EricCc: Schmidt, Jon; Taylor, Gina; Cebryk, DougSubject: RE: Confidentiality of Sun Devil???We have already been in contact primarily with most of the state andFederallevel agencies that exist in both AZ and NM as well as the Navajoagencies.I could get you a complete list of agencies we ve contacted if you dlike,but almost every agency that would or could issue a permit in bothstateshas been contacted.

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron s remaining management team to direct the company s ongoing operations.I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.Ken Lay",

Although these jitters have led to higher early-November prices, the winter market looks to be well supplied owing to the combination of milder weather, depressed demand, high storage levels, and ample production. December Henry Hub prices are expected to average $2.70 per MMBtu.* US gas storage inventories are estimated to leveled off at 3,107 billion cubic feet (Bcf) by the end of October. Without harsher weather, the year-over-year storage surplus should swell to over 770 Bcf by end-December.* December demand will be significantly lower than in 2000 due largely to the milder weather expected this year.

Weekends and holidays, too.But we know that isn t the case.And we field a number of e-mails over the course of every week asking howto find articles that no longer are visible on the daily Web pages.The Web site, much like the paper, is a daily product. Each day, we presentthe current events of that day. And the next day, the events of that day. The daily links normally are functional for a couple of weeks, but they arevisible on the site for only one day. So the challenge is how to findyesterday s links tomorrow if you fail to visit the Web site every singleday. Obviously, we have at least something of a solution or we wouldn t bementioning the problem.The best solution would be a search routine that just hunted through all ofthe functional links on the site. It s a long, involved tale why we don thave something like this on the site, but we don t -- although we do haveit on our list of ongoing projects.In the absence of a search routine, we suggest subscribing to the dailyHTML e-mail versions of the major news sections of the site -- page one,local and state, business and/or sports. Overnight each day, we e-mail out special HTML versions of these four Webpages complete with links to all of the stories appearing on the Web siteas the day begins.   If you have an e-mail account that can handle HTML e-mail (basic AOLcannot), you can get several advantages over browser-only customers.For starters, you get a daily update in your e-mail each morning to let youknow what the major news of the day is. You can read over story summarieswithout having to open your browser. But if you do want to know more aboutan article, just click on it like it was a Web link and most mail clientswill launch your browser for you and open the complete article.If you miss visiting the Web site for a few days, the e-mails will bewaiting with the links no longer visible of the Web site itself. And if youkeep the e-mails for a few days, you have your own short-term archive ofWeb links to find articles from the past couple of weeks. A few folks who do not have HTML capabilities in their normal e-mailaccounts have set up accounts on free Web-based e-mail services likehotmail.com or eudoramail.com just to receive these e-mails each day.

Still she suffered horrendousburns over much of her upper body and face, and her survival wasquestionable for weeks after the attack.Out of this horrific incident, three generations of women in her familyhave had their lives changed forever. Statistic show that every 15 seconds somewhere in America a woman is beatenby a husband or boyfriend, and that every day four of them die.

Gov. Gray Davis said this week that progress was being made and a final agreement between the state and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric could be reached in either \"days or weeks.\"     But the tone in Davis s office when asked about the negotiations has changed.     \"The governor realizes it s in everyone s interest to resolve this as quickly as possible, but only if we get a good deal for California ratepayers, not at the expense of California ratepayers,\" said Steve Maviglio, the governor s press secretary.     A senior executive with Edison International, which has already reached an agreement in principle with Davis to sell the state its power lines for $2.76 billion, said Wednesday the company is \"not getting much reaction from the state on a final agreement and there is a growing concern that time is running out.\"     \"Obviously I don t think the status quo can go on much longer,\" the executive said. \"The urgency rests with the governor s office. The ball is in his court.\"     The executive wouldn t say what is delaying a final resolution.     The Davis plan, introduced last month, would have the state buy the power lines owned by the utilities for about $7.5 billion and allow the utilities to issue bonds to restructure any remaining debt.     Maviglio wouldn t elaborate on the negotiations, but an aide to Davis who is familiar with the negotiations said the talks between PG&E have fallen through.     \"They ve completely broke down,\" the aide said. \"The (Davis administration) hasn t negotiated with PG&E for about a week.\"     A PG&E spokesman wouldn t comment on the negotiations.     -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 15-03-01      DJ Calif Utils -2: Calif Gov: Talks Continue, Progress Made     The Davis administration said on the record that negotiations continue and they are meeting with all three utilities and continue to make progress, said Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Governor Davis.

The terms \"cost recovery adjustment charge\" or \"CRAC\" did not arise to the best of Mr. Sher s recollection. Also, to the best of Mr. Sher s recollection, the topics discussed were matters of general interest to economists. ?The topics discussed included commodity prices and load forecasting. ? 5. ? ? ? ?On or about March 6, 2001, Doug Brawley, PNGC, left a voice mail message for Bob Procter, BPA, starting at about 3:00 pm and lasting about two minutes. ?Mr. Brawley pointed out that in GRSPs Section Q- Low Density Discount, Sub Section 7- Application of LDD to Slice, in the third line from the bottom in paragraph 3, the words \"Financial Based (FB) and Safety Net (SN) should be inserted between (TAC) and CRAC - in order to properly reflect the intent of the Settlement Proposal. ?Mr. Procter did not respond to this voice mail message.",

With the labor true-up process in place it really does not matter what the standard rates are; at month end the standard rate used when someone exception codes, is trued-up to actual.  During the month you can have a variance before the true-up takes place.  From an O&M standpoint ETS does not utilize the real time reporting feature of SAP due to our cost allocation model.  IF Project Systems is being utilized to manage real-time project costs, during the month, a variance will always exist prior to true up.  Routine rate review and maintenance will limit the variance.My recommendation is that if adjustments are made they should be coordinated at the ETS consolidated level.  At the time of the SAP implementation Allison Milan conducted a study across the different companies and Accounting set the rates with the participation of HR.  Since going live with SAP the integrity of the ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates and their application to all cost centers has not been maintained because there is not central control point for this process.Theoretically they should now be off by the merit increase in 2001.  Each year at merit time would be the logical time to make adjustments to the rates.  An option would be to wait until 2002 merit time and make adjustments based on 2001 and 2002 merit results.  It would also be a good time to synchronize all of the ETS \"F\" cost centers with the same rates.If I can provide any additional help, please let me know.  Thanks.

        "body": "This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty s lawyer, paragraph by paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another.Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like \"Except as set forth under paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe master agreement shall prevail.If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to \"The agreements listed beloweachcomprises a\" or better yet \"Each agreement listed below is a\" rather than \"The agreements listed below comprise the\".

Their number is 800-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and it s under my name.  The guy I talked to said he ll have to call during regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.  Each person s share is currently $905.33.  That includes one night in the Moorings hotel so will go down by 55.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all.  Beverages are covered by a separate payment.  I ll be glad to fax the invoice when you get a number for me.  If you want to send me your check, that s fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.Regarding \"connectedness,\"  there were no internet cafes the last time I was there.  While that may have changed, there won t be more than one or two in the entire place, I m sure.  Were you planning on bringing your laptop?  If so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won t have 110 volt current on the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.  It will be easy to check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.  But it s not cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min. to receive a call from the States and $2/min. to place one) and I m reasonably comfortable that you won t be able to plug into it.  I m not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not.  We can find out from the Moorings.  I have an international cell phone I m bringing along that also has infrared capability.  Does your laptop have one of those ir receivers?  If so, I can bring along the software you need to work it with this phone.  Not to be defeatist and I m sure the times have changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to receive & send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon ran the machine out of paper.  When we asked for more paper it turns out we had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.  Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.  Let me just add in the spirit of self-preservation that it s a good idea.  It s not safe to ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.  Obviously feel free to bring as many of your own cd s as you want & if you let us know what types of tunes you like we ll try and bring ours (if any) that match.  Don t worry too much about Ted s taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman & headphones!Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generationto the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse,the best strategy is to dismount.However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors tobe taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be triedwith dead horses, including the following:     1.   Buying a stronger whip.     2.   Changing riders.     3.   Threatening the horse with termination.     4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse.     5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.     6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.     7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.     8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.     9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.     10.  Change the form so that it reads: \"This horse is not dead.\"     11.  Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.     12.  Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.     13.  Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting          its full original cost.     14.  Providing additional funding to increase the horse s performance.     15.  Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would          improve productivity.     16.  Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.     17.  Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs          better.     18.  Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.     19.  Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.     20.  Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.",

We need to check with Robert George on this issue.)Imbedded Capital Contracts--(Scott Porter raised the issue of developing a new form of template with Andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with Robert George.)Distribution Contracts--The commercial group would like to have preapproved distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a commercial bypass.  Only two distributors have had their form approved by the ENARGAS.  We are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution contracts with the LDCs to avoid long delays.ENARGAS Expedientes--ENARGAS has issued an order to Enron to amend three of its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle the pricing.  The ENARGAS also sent a letter to our customers which we feel overstepped their regulatory role.  The meeting between Roberto Pensoti and Hector Formica was held last Thursday.  Roberto had a follow up phone conversation with Hector on Friday and had a meeting Monday morning with Alicia Federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get. We have been given a 30 day extension to respond to the order in order to have meetings with the ENARGAS and try to come to some resolution on this issue. The first meeting will be scheduled early next week.Neuquen Tax Assessment--Andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information regarding the stamp tax assessment on the Technical Assistance Agreement between TGS and EPCA to George Frumkin, Anna Sepulveda and Michelle Blaine who will co-ordinate with TGS and Perez Companc on the strategy for responding to the assessment.  Michelle will call TGS outside counsel today in order to hire him to also represent EPCA.  EPCA has filed its response to Neuquen using the arguments prepared by TGS on January 27.  Michelle Blaine has requested information regarding what the next step by Neuquen might possibly be.  We will look into the issue.Tax Lobbying--Jordan Mintz and Terry Thorn are proposing a series of meetings with government officials in late February and have asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can also arrange a meeting with Mr. Lenicov at that time.  Issues include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level.  There is a proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the VAT tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax.  The focus of the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who should be involved in the actual lobbying process.  Jordan Mintz is handing off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to Jim Ginty.  Jordan has asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with Mr. Lenicov on March 11th or 12th since Terry Thorn can be in Buenos Aires on those days.Transportation Capacity Release Guidelines--Must review and comment on new ENARGAS proposed guidelines by February 5.  Comments were made on February 5.Vandenfil--Vandenfil has filed for a pre-bankruptcy proceeding which has not yet been \"opened\" by the court due to the January recess.  For the last three months Vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending themtermination notices with a two business day cure period.    The most likelyscenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will be \"continued\" by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing deliveries of gas.  After the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not been served notice that our contract is \"continued\" within 30 days we would be allowed to terminate the contract.  One of the risks that we face with this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate the contract claiming we are providing a public service.Imasa Bid--Format of Enron s original proposal structure changed.  Enron and Albanesi submitted joint termsheet to Central Puerto in November  where Enron proposed signing two contracts with Central Puerto, one for the supply of all the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas requirements and Albanesi proposed two contracts, one for supplying 40 percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline spur.  Central Puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of January 25, 1999.Dow Pipeline Spur Feasibility Study--Enron and Dow are studying the feasibility of building a pipeline between TGS and two affiliates of Dow. Issues include determining whether our CEIASA shareholder and owners agreements preclude Enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory guidelines.  Andrea will be putting together a short report based on her meeting with Nestor Martinez.   A team meeting consisting of legal, regulatory, commercial, credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the broad parameters of the Dow spur proposal.  The commercial group is preparing a first draft of a build, operate and finance termsheet that they would like to present to the customer on Thursday to be reviewed by Robert George. Credit is still doing its analysis of the two proposed counterparties.Contract Review--Preliminary gas contract reviews for Central Puerto and Ave Fenix for Rob Rice and Federico Cerisoli.Gas Deals:Chauvco--20 day gas supply contract being draftedCerro VanGuardia--Amendment to the gas sale agreement being drafted to cover negotiated changes to the take or pay provisions.Bagley--Two Offer letters sent to two Bagley entities for review, Enron was not the low bidder.  I have been asked by to look into how other \"marketers\" are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are.  The customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually requesting a contract template for distribution services.  The contract is slated to begin March 23, however, the distributor has 30 days to respond for requests for distribution services.Total--Spot master agreement proposed for transactions out of Neuquen.  Short term draft offer for gas out of Chubut being reviewed by Total.  A separate one year supply contract template supplied by Total is being reviewed.  The customers template contains the same type of language that gave us Antitrust trouble in the PCR contract.  Peidra Buena--Gas sale agreement for peakinggas.    Final offer sent and Gas has started flowing.  We are now working ona one year contract.  A termsheet has been sent to the customer. Dow--Negotiating offer letter format for sale of gas to two Dow affiliates. Gas deal is related to but independent of the spur issue.  A mark up of draft has been received the end of last week, Dow indicates that further comments are to be sent soon.Power Deals:We need to draft an output marketing form of contract for the purchase of electricity.Argentine Signatories:Scott Neal has approved a new structure for signatories in Argentina.

Freshfields is one of the premier UK law firms (although not necessarily the most widespread internationally) with a great reputation and client list. I cannot see any reason why this should impact upon our working relationships with that firm at all.So unless you think I m missing something, I would be wholly supportive.

Rob, Jordan and I have been considering this from a legal relationships perspective and request your thoughts on same.  Tobias Munk of DealBench has been working on developing this DealBench/Freshfields relationship for a couple of months.  Tobias came to DealBench from Enron London to help develop a capability to do due diligence on the DealBench platform (the dataroom product).  He initiated contact with Freshfields (Hugh Crisp) before moving to Houston.   DealBench has been aware that this relationship would be subject to approval by Enron legal management.The proposed relationship essentially is a business referral one:  DealBench would pay Freshfields 10% of site license fees paid to DealBench by customers referred by Freshfields.  Freshfields also would provide up to 100 hours of consulting services regarding the dataroom product for no additional monetary consideration but DealBench would give Freshfields exclusive recognition for helping DealBench develop the dataroom product in Europe and Asia. DealBench advises that Freshfields believes it would benefit from the publicity associated with being part of the development of an e-commerce product.  The DealBench commercial team is very interested in moving forward with Freshfields.  Although Freshfields cannot guarantee any referrals, DealBench believes the relationship would be fruitful for it commercially because of Freshfields  prominence in M&A transactions in Europe and Asia. Before DealBench moves further with Freshfields, it would like legal clearance.  We look forward to hearing from you.Regards, NJDNora J.

I had the following thoughts.1.  I think the revised Section 4(b) set forth below in your mail is fine; the only thing that I believe it leaves out (and I assume you are comfortable not having it) is the counterparty s use of information or content on the website.  I had included that clause to cover situations in which the counterparty uses information on the website but not in connection with an EOL transaction (e.g., reliance on information in making trading decisions that are executed elsewhere) or where the counterparty passes information from the website on to a third party.  I think the language in your draft covers the most important stuff.  I point this out only to be clear on why I had included \"use\".2.  I am not sure the lead in to 4(c) (\"Subject to clause 4(b)\") should be included.  It seems to suggest that the counterparty could be liable for consequential damages, etc. for the things covered in 4(b), which I suspect will be difficult for Shell to accept.3.  Will 4(a) remain in the Agreement?  I think it should, because there are things covered in (a) that should not be mutual but should be retained; e.g., no liability for timeliness, accuracy, etc. and exculpation for use of the website.  However, if (a) is retained, perhaps we should strike those portions in the current version of (a) that will be covered by (c); e.g., exclusion of consequential and punitive damages, etc.   Otherwise, (c) will be duplicative with respect to Enron s liabiity, which could be confusing.4.  Two \"nits\" in Section 4(b) of the version of the ETA attached to your e-mail --\"Website\" is misspelled as \"Webiste\" in the sixth line, and the \"(ii)\" in the next line should be deleted.Please let me know if you want to discuss.  Hope all is well with you.  Thanks.>>> <Justin.Boyd@enron.com> 10/24 4:22 AM >>>DavidI had a few minor suggestions, as set out below.  Please also note thefollowing:   SHELL had requested that the limitation of liability in clause 4(a) be   mutual; I have therefore left clause 4(a) as it stands, but added new   clause 4(c) below.   The risk of including the language in (b)(ii) below is that SHELL will   ask for Enron for a  indemnity to the extent that SHELL suffers Loss   arising out of Enron s breach of the Agreement.  I have also sought to   restrict the circumstances where breach by SHELL would trigger the   indemnity - I believe sub-clauses (a), (c) and (d) of clause 2 capture   these.     (b)   Counterparty  shall  indemnify, protect, and hold harmless Enronand  its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any andall  losses,          liabilities,  judgments, suits, actions, proceedings,claims,  damages,  and  costs  (including  attorneys   fees) (collectively,\"Loss\")  resulting  from  or arising out of (i) any   Transactions executedthrough  the  Website by any person obtaining access to the Website throughthe  Passwords  (as  defined in the Password Application), whether   or notCounterparty  has  authorized  such  access, or (ii) any material breach byCounterparty  of  its  obligations  under  clause  2(a), (c) or (d) of thisAgreement,  provided       that,  in  no  event  will Counterparty have anyliability  under  this clause 4(b) for any Loss caused by the negligence orwilful misconduct of Enron.     (c)   SUBJECT  TO CLAUSE 4(b), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLETO  THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,         PUNITIVEOR  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS,LOSS  OF  PROFIT,  LOSS  OR  CORRUPTION  OF  DATA,    LOSS  OF  GOODWILL ORREPUTATION  OR WASTED MANAGEMENT TIME) WHICH MAY BE INCURRED OR EXPERIENCEDON ACCOUNT OF EITHER          PARTY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

We have no comments on this point.2. As to clause 5(c)(i) and the amended (iii), we have no objection.Howeverit is our opinion that both of the parties represent and warrant eachother.As to (ii), we are informed by Mr. Ono that this transaction does not comeunder (ii) for ToaRe as its purpose is not hedging. If ToaRe represents andwarrants as clause 5(c)(ii), it is false representation and warranty.Clause5(c)(ii) therefore should be deleted.We think clause 5(c)(iii) is a good enough representation to clear thegambling matter.3. It is our opinion that Japanese law is better for our client in the ISDAMaster.4.Our suggestion is JPY1,000,000,000.5.

This has been done in consultation withyour client so I don t expect this to be a problem.2.   We cannot give the warranties in clause 5(c).  We also do not acceptyour client s reasons for not giving the warranties to us but asalternative to paragraph (iii), would suggest you warrant the legality ofyour entering into of the contract.  We trust you can have no objections tothis new warranty.  In our opinion, the analysis you have suggested inrelation to paragraph (ii) is relevant only in the context of a creditderivative and not a weather derivative so would ask that this be retained.3.   We have agreed to Japanese law but only on the understanding that yourclient will agree to New York law (or UK law if they prefer) for the ISDAwhich we will start negotiating as soon as this confirmation is finalizedand on the basis that you accept our amended form of clause 5.4.

        "body": "In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it indetail.1.  The IssueThe essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12,i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claimthat the transaction is not binding because:(a) it was outside the company s business purposes, or(b) execution of the application was not authorized.This issue is not unique to JapanThere is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the tradingof any of the products through the internet, including issues as to contractualenforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advisedon 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the ElectronicTrading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the contract.(We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)2.  Enron s Practice re EOLOur understanding is that:* Potential customers have been sent the password application under coverof a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.  Neitherthe letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.* Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a creditstandpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm theauthority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking ifthe signatory shows the title \"director\" alongside his name).* If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the applicationand issues a password.* Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today andnone has yet been approved.3.  Business PurposesArticle 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights andobligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in itsconstituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside itsbusiness purposes, the contract is prima facie void.However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the powerof the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, thecontract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of thecounterparty s business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by arepresentative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transactionfalls within those purposes.However, since Japanese companies  business purposes, after listing a limitednumber of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of\"all incidental or ancillary business\", it is common for companies to not makethis inquiry except in the most major contracts.With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because oftentheir business purposes are in fact limited.Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name doesnot contain \"Kabushiki Kaisha\" or \"Yugen Gaisha\" at the end of the name, to makefurther inquiries.4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The LawThe position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in thesense that:(a)  Deemed AuthorityThe law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party topresume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of acontract by the company s \"representative director\".  This corresponds to thepresumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the USand in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted bylaw or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the CivilCode) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract isstill binding on the company.(b)  Apparent AuthorityIn common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority.Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides: \"A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act doneby a director invested with any title such as president, vice president,executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he hasauthority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no powerof representation.\"Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to \"generalmanagers\" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 thenapplies the concept to \"an employee who has been entrusted with certain types ofmatters or specific matters.\"Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262(above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general managerand division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to representthe company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the company sbusiness for which they are responsible.It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho)have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they areresponsible.(e)  Holding OutEven if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, ifthe company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will bebound by his/her action.5.  Practical ConsiderationsIn formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law, thefollowing factors are relevant:(a)  Practice regarding Representative Director SealIt is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the presumptionreferred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director s corporateseal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  toinsist on tracing the \"chain of authority\" of the signatory up to therepresentative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusualtransactions.(b)  Size of TransactionThe question is what transactions fall into the \"major\" or \"unusual\" category.Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As inmany other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in (c),(d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerableongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised tobe asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written confirmationof the signatory s authority to be obtained from a person at such level.(c)  Size of CompanyWhile it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representativedirector s seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case of asmaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of amajor company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in whichcompanies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.(d)  Business Department of SignatoryThe counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authoritydoctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) therelevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.(e)  Degree of ExposureTo the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to exposethe counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty inthe future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant areasonably conservative approach.(f)  Recent HistoryHowever, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economiccrisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generallyattempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because ofreputation considerations.(g) Identity of AddresseeThe title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant.For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department,but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argumentthat the company had held the section chief out as having the necessaryauthority.(h)  Internal ProceduresSince the law concerning execution by a representative director can beconsidered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal insome countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japaneserules are not out of line with those of other countries.Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent approachto Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in othercountries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient forJapan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan s uniqueregime of company titles.6.  Conservative ApproachIf the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for thecounter-party, under common practice Enron would require:* The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and countersigned by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to producedocumentation showing a line of authority originating with a representativedirector.* A certified copy of the seal register.* A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the LegalAffairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of therepresentative director.7.  Less Conservative ApproachMajor CompaniesFor major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and othercompanies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted whichwould not be out of line with market practice:* The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho)of the relevant department or above, or* By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by aperson at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho), butthis is right \"on the line\" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there issome history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up anapparent authority argument.Smaller CompaniesFor other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark fordividing between small and large companies.8.  Likely Response of Target  CompaniesYour marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view but,taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any companyis likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to anapplication signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach,particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with thecorrespondence and application form the companies have been sent and noapplications have yet been approved.RegardsPaul Davis/Hideo Ohta__________________________________Baker & McKenzie Advice of 15 March 2000Dear Mark:I refer to you e-mail of March 3 sent to my partner, Paul Davis.

We willlet you know if we find any previous or future statements.>> 2.

In particular, if a> transaction> entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or> U.K. law and the> transactions contain a choice of such law, will such> transactions, including the> choice of law, be enforceable in Japan?We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or tradingof any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  UnderJapanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers oracceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties maymake most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishingthat the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In mostsimple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy toprove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller selectronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy productY should be enough in this context.In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller s Web pages should becarefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to thequestion of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, thelegal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may besomewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over thecounter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases theproduct. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click onan Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, with acarefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able tolet the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on theicon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms andconditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrapin the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that thecustomer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly maybe more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or U.K.law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.>> 3.

I amnow 6-6 for the season on the College Best Bets, but 3 of the losses have been by lessthan 3 points and I expect those close games to even out. I have 4 Best Bets this week,one 3-Star and three 2-Stars and I also list 4 Strong Opinions below, including theThursday Night ESPN game. Remember, I only play the Best Bets, but Strong Opinions havewon more than they have lost over the years. Good Luck this week.3 Star SelectionMARYLAND (-9.5) 34 West Virginia 13Ralph Friedgen has turned around the Terps and has them headed for a bowl game after a 3-0 start. That start is no mirage as Maryland has plenty of talent and has posted solidwins of 23-7 over a good North Carolina team and 27-20 win on the road against a solidWake Forest team last week. Maryland s offense is averaging a robust 256 true rushingyards per game at 5.4 yards per rushing play (without sacks) and 156 true passing yardsat 5.9 yards per pass play (with sacks included). They will have no trouble today movingthe ball on a West Virginia defense that yields 5.1 yards per rush play and allowed lowlyKent State to compile 195 true rushing yards at 5.0 yprp on them last week. West Virginiadoes defend the pass well and I don t expect much of a contribution from Marylandquarterback Hill in this game. However, all Hill will have to do is hand the ball off andMaryland will be able to move down the field. The Terrapins  defense will make it toughfor a sluggish West Virginia offense to keep up. The Mountaineers average just 3.9 yardsper rushing play and a decent 6.2 yards per pass play (4.4 yprp and 5.9 yppp are thenational averages), but they have put up those numbers against teams that combine toallow an average of 4.9 yprp and 7.8 yppp on defense. In other words, the Mounties haveput up mediocre offensive numbers against teams that have allowed other offenses to moveat will. Maryland s defense has allowed only 3.8 yprp and 4.1 yppp against 3 teams notknown for their offense (NC, E. Mich, and WF), but and average defense would hold those 3teams an average of about 4.2 yprp and 5.1 yppp. Thus, Maryland s defense has performedbetter than average thus far and will have no problem limiting West Virginia s offense inthis game. West Virginia was blown out 10-34 at Boston College and they are just 1-9 ATSon the road since the last few years. Maryland qualifies in a 103-36-1 ATS statisticalindicator that has been money in the bank for me over the years. This is a solid 3-StarBest Bet.2 Star SelectionBOSTON COLLEGE (-24.5) 45 Army 10Boston College could have beaten Navy by more than the 38-21, but after leading 35-14after 3 quarters coach Tom O Brien, a former coach at Navy, may have eased up a bitrather than embarrass the Middies on their home turf on an emotional day. The Eaglesstill ended up tallying 232 rushing yards at 5.3 ypr and 247 pass yards at 9.5 yppagainst a poor Navy defense. Army s defense is also bad and I doubt that they will beshown much mercy here at Alumni Stadium, where the Eagles have covered the spread 10consecutive times. The BC offense will have another huge day against an Army defense thatallowed 439 total yards per game last season and is surrendering 466 total yards per gamethis year. Boston College averaged 4.8 yards per rush last year and they re rushing for229 yards per game at an even better 5.3 ypr this season. Superstar back William Greenwill have another huge game against a Cadets  defense that has allowed 4.6 ypr lastseason and has yielded 4.1 ypr this season to Cincinnati and UAB, teams that combine toaverage just 3.5 ypr on offense. Quarterback Brian St. Pierre struggled in the first 2games of the season against the good pass defenses of West Virginia and Stanford, but heblossomed last week against a soft Navy defense (19 or 25 for 247 yards) and will havecomparable success this week against an Army secondary that allowed 7.8 yards per passlast year and has allowed 74% completions for 8.0 ypp this season. The Army offense isbetter this season, but Boston College has a solid defensive unit that has allowed anaverage of just 4.7 yards per play against a schedule of teams that has averaged 5.1yards per play on offense. Army has averaged just 300 total yards in their 2 games whiletossing 5 interceptions. Boston College gave up a few big pass plays to Navy, but theyallowed just 6.4 yards per pass last season and should be just as good this year. Armylost 3-55 at UAB last week and this should be another beating. My ratings math systempredicts a 45-10 win for Boston College in this game and they have shown that they do notlet up at home. BC is a perfect 5-0 ATS as a home favorite of more than 14 points incoach O Brien s first 4 years, winning those games by an average score of 43-9 whilelaying an average of 22 points. In addition to Boston College s strong history at homeand my math system also favoring them, the Cadets qualify in a negative 5-33 ATS earlyseason big road underdog situation. Army lost 17-55 at home to BC last year and I ll takethe Eagles to administer another whipping to the Cadets today.<p><b>Pass if Boston College is favored by more than 28 points</b>.2 Star SelectionLSU (+10) 17   TENNESSEE 20In what should be a defensive battle, I will gladly take the generous points with a well-balanced LSU squad that runs and throws well on offense while defending the run and passwell on defense. Tennessee does all of those things well also, but the Tigers qualify ina 30-8 ATS early season indicator if they are getting 10 points or more. Aside from theangle that applies to LSU, the Tigers also can match up with Tennessee. LSU is led onoffense by mistake-free quarterback Rohan Davey, who has averaged 9.0 yards per pass withjust 1 interception in 137 passes since the beginning of last season and guided theTigers to upsets of Tennessee and Georgia Tech last season. I rate the Tigers as just anaverage rushing team, but they are good enough to keep the Vols  defense honest.Tennessee s defense is very good in all areas and they had no trouble shutting down themediocre Syracuse offense and a bad Arkansas attack unit. LSU racked up 460 total yardsand scored 38 points against the Vols last year even though Davey was hobbled for most ofthe second half (they scored 24 points in the first half). I expect LSU to once again beable to move the ball on Tennessee well enough to stay within the big number. Tennessee soffense is good both running and throwing, but have averaged just 4.0 ypr and 6.2 ypp intheir first two games against the tough stop units of Syracuse and Arkansas. Tennesseewill struggle even more offensively in this game against an LSU defense that has allowedjust 2.8 ypr and 5.8 ypp against two decent offensive teams (Tulane and Utah State) withmuch of the damage in those games coming in garbage time after the Tigers had built hugeleads. Tennesee has been good at home in recent years (10-4 ATS since  99), but LSU coachNick Saban is 9-4 ATS as an underdog going back to his days at Michigan State and myratings favor the Volunteers by only 4 points in this game. LSU also qualifies in a 97-39-3 ATS road underdog situation and a 30-8 ATS early season indicator if they remain andunderdog of 10 points or more. I ll take the points with an LSU squad that is very goodon both sides of the ball.2 Star SelectionTCU (-6.5) 24 HOUSTON 10The Horned Frogs have been great defensively again this year, but have really struggledon offense with an inexperience offensive line and without LaDainian Tomlinson. TCU isaveraging only 3.1 yards per rushing play this season, a far cry from the 5.4 yprp thatthey averaged last year. I expect the Frogs to have some success running the ball in thisgame against a Houston defense that has allowed 5.3 yprp against Rice and Texas. Rice andTexas are pretty decent running teams, but Houston has allowed more to those teams thanan average defense would and I rate the Cougars as below average in that area. Houston isabout average defending the pass, but TCU quarterback Casey Printers is a better thanaverage passer and should put up pretty good numbers in this game. While TCU s offenseshould perk up a bit against a soft Houston defense, the Horned Frogs  defense will putthe clamps on the Cougars offense. Houston gained just 199 total yards at home againstRice, but somehow managed to collect 432 yards on the road against a very good Texasdefense. Overall, I rate the Houston rush attack as non-existent and the pass attackbetter than average with Kelly Robertson blossoming last week with a very good effort(although he was horrible against Rice). TCU has allowed just 3.8 yards per rushing playand 4.5 yards per pass play this season and were very impressive in holding Nebraska tojust 21 points in their opener last month. TCU gave up 27 points in their surprising homeloss to Northwestern State last week, but I will consider that an aberration and look forthe Frogs to shut down Houston s attack today by dominating the Cougars  offensive lineand putting pressure on Robertson. TCU has registered 14 sacks in just 110 pass plays intheir 4 games (that s 13% sacks!) while Houston has allowed 9 sacks in 2 games at a rateof 10% of their pass plays. The national average is 2 sacks per game, or 6% of all passplays, so you can expect a sack on about 17% of Houston s pass plays in this game. WithRobertson not having ample time to find his quality receivers, the Horned Frogs shouldcome away with a solid victory. My ratings favor TCU to win this game by 6 points, whichis right on the number, but the Horned Frogs qualify in a 145-54 ATS statisticalindicator and a 67-17-2 ATS subset of that angle also applies. That indicator has beenVERY good to me in recent years as it is 53-14 ATS since 1995. I ve been on most of thosegames as Best Bets and have been sorry when I wasn t. So, I ll take TCU for a 2-Star BestBet.Strong OpinionPITTSBURGH (+27.5) 17  Miami Fla 38Miami looks like a deserved #1 team right now with an easy 33-7 win at Penn State and a61-0 roasting of Rutgers 3 weeks ago. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, inexplicably lost 26-35 athome to South Florida as a 23 point favorite. I consider that game to be a fluke andexpect the Panthers to as good as the team that won 7 games last season. The Pitt offenseis led by an experienced David Priestly at quarterback, who has averaged over 8 yards perpass in over 300 passes in his career. Priestly has struggled some this year withoutinjured All-American receiver Antonio Bryant, who is listed as probable for his returnthis game. Pitt doesn t have much of a rush attack this year without graduated star KevanBarlow (now with the 49ers), so the Priestly will have to be at his best in this gameagainst a secondary that is among the nation s best. My ratings project 17 points forPitt if Bryant plays and 14 points if he does not. Miami s offense is also one of thebest units in the nation with quarterback Ken Dorsey leading an offense that is averaging330 pass yards per game at an incredible 12.4 yards per pass and 243 rushing yards pergame at a robust 5.6 yards per rush. Pitt s defense did not play as poorly against SouthFlorida as it appears. The Panthers did allow 443 total yards in that game but SouthFlorida ran 97 plays. Pitt allowed 3.1 yards per rush and just 5.3 yards per pass, bothgood numbers. With 10 returning starters on that side of the ball, I expect the Panthersto be better than last year s unit that allowed only 2.6 yards per rush and 6.6 yards perpass. Last year, Pittsburgh s defense limited Miami to 5.4 yards per play, almost a fullyard per play less than the 6.3 yards per play that the Hurricanes averaged for theseason. A -3 in turnover margin led to a misleading 7-35 loss for Pitt down in Miami andI expect the Panthers to be just as competitive with Miami this year at home. Pittsburghis 10-4 ATS as a home underdog in recent years and their defense is good enough to slowdown Miami s offense a bit while their offense is good enough to score a couple of times,especially if Bryant is able to contribute. Consider Pittsburgh a Strong Opinion ifByrant plays and a lean if he does not.Strong OpinionTEXAS A&M (-3) 21 Notre Dame 13The Irish are now 0-2 with losses to Nebraska and Michigan State and it appears as ifthey will go 0-3 after their visit to Kyle Field, where the Aggies are 11-2 ATS the last3 years and 60% ATS in coach Slocum s 14 years at the helm. Notre Dame is averaging just3.4 yards per play this season and I rate them as just average both running and passingafter compensating their statistics for the high level of opposition faced. The problemfor them here is that an average offense is not good enough to score many points here inCollege Station against an A&M defense that is yielding just 3.8 yards per play thisseason after allowing only 4.7 yards per play last year. Texas A&M is good defending therun (3.3 ypr last year) and is even better against the pass, so I expect the Irish tostruggle once again throwing the football against another good secondary. The Aggies offense has been mediocre so far, but quarterback Mark Farris averaged 7.5 yards per passlast season and will take advantage of a mediocre Notre Dame secondary that allowed 7.7yards per pass last year and 8.7 ypp in 2 games this season. I don t see the Aggiesrunning very well, but they will get enough plays through the air to reach the endzone afew times. Teams that struggle offensively and lose straight up as a favorite at homehave proven to be bad plays on the road the next week, so this is not a great situationfor the Irish to right their ship.Strong OpinionTEXAS (-17.5) 35 Texas Tech 13Texas is playing below last year s high standards despite returning 9 starters on offenseand 8 starters on defense. The Longhorns are averaging just 5.5 yards per play on offensewhile allowing 4.8 yards per play and they ve done so against a fairly weak schedule.Last year, by contrast, the Horns averaged 5.9 yards per play on offense and yielded just4.1 yards per play against a tough schedule. I suspect Texas has been bored by theopposition they ve had to face as they are certainly no worse than they were a year ago.They should not have a problem getting up for this conference game against an improvedTexas Tech team. The Red Raiders were not a very good offensive team last year in thefirst season in coach Mike Leach s Air Raid offense, but quarterback Kingsbury and therest of the offense appear to be much more comfortable this season as Tech is averaging asolid 5.5 yards per play. Texas had the second best pass defense in the nation last year (4.1 yards per pass play allowed - including sacks) and they return 3 of 4 starters fromthat secondary. The Red Raiders were limited to just 299 yards by Texas last year and Iexpect similar results this season. Texas Tech does have a solid defensive unit againthis year and they are particularly tough to throw on. However, Texas will be able toestablish their running game against a soft Red Raiders  defensive front and quarterbackSimms should have plenty of time to throw the football. Simms will need to step up hisplay against this Texas Tech defense and I suspect that he will. Texas qualifies in asolid 167-98-4 ATS early season indicator and they have been able to outscore theiropponents by an average of 30 points per game despite not playing very well. If the Hornsplay up to their potential, they will have no problem here and that strong indicatorsuggests that they will play better than they have thus far.Strong OpinionARIZONA ST. (-15) 45 San Jose St. 24The Sun Devils took a beating at Stanford against a very good Cardinal squad, but theywill bounce back here at home against a defenseless Spartans  squad. Arizona State coachKoettner hails from Boise State, where his Broncos were among the highest scoring teamsin the nation last year (44 points per). Sophomore quarterback Jeff Krohn has picked upthe offense very well and the Sun Devils averaged 8.3 yards per pass play in their first2 games against two good defensive teams (San Diego State and Stanford). San Jose Stateis not a good defensive - they are a bad one - and ASU will have no trouble scoringpoints tonight. The Spartans are actually not bad defending the run, as they have allowed5.1 yards per rushing play to USC and Colorado teams that would rush for that averageagainst an average defense. San Jose, however, can not stop the pass as they havesurrendered 8.2 yards per pass play this season against USC and Colorado, teams that Iproject at a combined 6.9 yards per pass play on offense against an average defense. WithASU averaging 8.3 yppp against two good defensive teams, you can imagine how easy it willbe for them to throw against the Spartans tonight and the Sun Devils are also a decentrunning team. San Jose State does have a good offense that averaged 5.8 yards per rushingplay and 6.0 yards per pass play last season and returns 9 starters to that unit. TheSpartans attack has been slowed by two very good defensive teams in USC and Colorado, butthey should be able to run the ball against a Sun Devils defense that allowed 5.1 yprplast year and 5.2 yprp this season. Arizona State does have an excellent secondary, so Idon t expect Marcus Arroyo to have too much of a positive impact today. ASU coachKoettner loves to entertain the home fans and his teams have covered the spread 13consecutive times at home (12 straight at Boise and a 38-7 win over San Diego State). InKoettner s last 6 games as a home favorite, his teams have won by an average score of 54-28 while being favored by an average of 11 ? points. Koettner is also 9-2 ATS in gamesfollowing a loss the last 4 years and will be looking for a big win to atone for lastweek s 28-51 loss at Stanford. He will get it.---------------------------------------------------------------Your subsciption to this package ends on 07-Feb-02.",

Because ofthis a general statement like \"the allowable tons/year for SO2 in HarrisCounty is .......\" would not be defendable or valid.  2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the seasonof year and part of the state - a.k.a., \"ambient background threshold\".In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probablywould be lower.  3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap forcertain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will beadjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could beas little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permitsare initiated.  4)  Texas charges corporations a \"tax\" for emissions over theirallowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I ambeing very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.  Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answeras possible.  I hope I am not being too pointed but to the data orientedperson, the previous points are important for data integrity.

This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I m not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was \"additional margin\".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.

        "body": "Bob,This e-mail describes the tax consequences arising from Enron North America Corp. (\"ENA\") offering to sell various pulp and paper products (\"Products\") through EnronOnline (\"EOL\") to counterparties throughout Europe whereby such Products would be stored in bonded warehouses located in the Netherlands.  As I understand, it is intended that any ENA counterparty located in Europe will be able to purchase Products from ENA and obtain physical possession of such Products by taking delivery within bonded warehouses located in the Netherlands that are owned by unrelated parties to whom ENA would make payments for providing storage space.  The tax consequences arising from ENA s sales of Products in the Netherlands are described below.  (I will follow-up as soon as possible to provide you with the tax consequences arising from ENA engaging in the same activity in Belgium.)Sales within a bonded warehouse in The NetherlandsIn general, sales of Products by ENA in the Netherlands may be subject to taxation in both the United States and the Netherlands, thus resulting in a combined effective tax rate equal to at least 58 percent.  By selling Products in a specific manner, however, ENA can substantially limit its exposure to taxation in the Netherlands and, by doing so, should only be subject to U.S. taxation (at a rate equal to 35 percent).To limit its exposure to Dutch taxation on the sale of Products stored in a bonded warehouse in the Netherlands that is owned by an unrelated party, ENA should comply with all of the following criteria:Other than the limited activity to be performed on behalf of ENA by the owner of the bonded warehouse (\"Warehouseman\") described below, all of ENA s activities related to the sale of Products to a counterparty should occur in the United States.  For example, the pricing for the Products to be offered should be determined by an ENA employee physically located in the U.S.  If any negotiations occur between ENA and a counterparty, the ENA employee engaged in negotiations should be physically located in the United States.  If a contract is entered into between the parties, an ENA employee should execute the document while physically present in the United States.  (As I understand, those transactions effected through EOL occur by the counterparty making an offer (i.e., clicking on the \"offer\" icon contained in EOL) and are accepted by ENA if (among other things) the price related to the counterparty s offer is still valid.  If this is the case, then ENA s \"acceptance\" should be considered to occur in the U.S. if the individual with the authority to set prices is physically located in the U.S. when actually setting the price.)ENA should enter into an agreement with the Warehouseman located in the Netherlands whereby the Warehouseman s only activities on behalf of ENA consist of storing the Products and making them available to the counterparty to take physical delivery at the warehouse.  The Warehouseman should not have the authority to engage in any other activity on behalf of ENA, including (but not limited to):    a.  negotiating any of the terms of the agreement between ENA and the counterparty;  b.  concluding any agreement between ENA and the counterparty on behalf of ENA;  c.  soliciting or receiving orders from a counterparty on behalf of ENA (and transmitting such orders back to ENA); and  d.  delivering Products to counterparties on behalf of ENA.Thus, for ENA to mitigate its risk of exposure to Dutch tax on sales of Products in the Netherlands, the Warehouseman should engage in only two activities on behalf of ENA:  storing the Products for a fee, and making such Products available to counterparties to take possession of them at the warehouse.  All other activities related to the sale of Products in the Netherlands should be undertaken by ENA in the United States.If you have any questions, please contact me at ext. 35777.Best regards,Jeff",

There will be different GTCs for Japanese and Australian weather products. However as it is planned that they will both have Enron Australia Finance Pty.Ltd. as the Enron contracting party and have designate New South Wales (an Australian State) as the choice of law the forms will be nearly Identical. The only differences currently relate to different data sources.There may also be additional changes that come out of the B&M review to accommodate the fact that the counterparty will almost certainly the incorporated in Japan. Hence we would want to take all possible steps to ensure that when we market these products in Japan we minimumise the possibility that we are that in breach of Japanese legislation. Furthermore although any transaction will be enforced in an Australian court if a counterparty only has assets in Japan then the ability to enforce a transaction would be relevant.However, there is no need to review the Australian weather GTCs for conformity with Japanese law. Whilst it is possible a Japanese incorporated company may seek to trade Australian weather they may also trade crude derivatives or US power. Rather than insert a provisions in all these GTCs the appropriate step is for signoff that it is appropriate for a particular Japanese counterparty to trade particular products. This is the process that is currently followed.Accordingly the Australian weather GTCs can now be loaded. The Japanese weather GTCs are awaiting B&M signoff.

We will likely have their comments by early next week (they know there is an urgency to this matter). My current view is that we probably can have one set of GTCs as long as the additional language (e.g., representations) suggested by local Japanese counsel for the Japanese counterpaties would not be confusing to the Australian counterparties who would be entering into the Australian weather products.

If you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for December.  Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances. Thanks,RobinKathy Reeves12/07/2000 06:46 PMTo: Robin Rodrigue/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Canada p&lRobinI would like to make sure before year end that the p&l being reporting for Canada ( trading profits only) equals what I think it is as per attached:Would you let me know what you are currently reporting for Canada.ThanksKathy",

        "body": "Here are my notes from today s call.  As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  \"The company is overlevered; that s a fact.\"--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker",

Cash NeedsHighlights:SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsHighlights:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under= such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan",

        "body": "Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron s business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron s performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.Following are the highlights of our businesses:Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.Transportation and Distribution:\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter s results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:?\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.?\t$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron s interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm s length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.

These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA.   As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a \"put\" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks.  These issues must also be resolved for financing.  GT11/12:  Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end.  Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures.  Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem.Shell:  Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.ANNEX VAfter reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.  I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations.Regards,   Michelle",

There are alot of unknowns on whether this project in the current environment with respect to energy development in Florida and Enron in particular will go forward.  We will probably know more toward the end of the year. As part of the process, if it goes forward, we will be a need to obtain a Water Agreement.  I believe there may have been some preliminary discussions months ago with the County concerning water requirements but nothing has occurred recently. At this time our folks do not want to talk with County about it for some reason. However, assuming that we might need a water agreement at sometime and probably on short notice, I decided at least to prepare a draft and thus be in position to talk with the County when and if the discussions ever to proceed.  The commercial provisions are not finalized yet but the draft contains what I think our folks may need.  I would appreciate your reviewing this draft and providing me your thoughts and any suggested changes.  I will call you next week to discuss this in more detail.  From a strategy standpoint we are not in position at this time to talk with the County or to let them know we may be preparing a draft.Have a great weekend.Thanks for your help.Randy Randall M.

Gray Davis earmarked $4 million of state funds so Lockyer s office caninvestigate claims of collusion, profiteering, price gouging and otheranticompetitive behavior on the part of generators.Generators such as Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) havevehemently denied the claims, saying their behavior in the wholesale electricitymarket has already been investigated by federal regulators and various stateagencies, all of whom have concluded that the companies did not violate anyantitrust laws.Recently, however, the California Independent System Operator, manager of thestate s electricity grid, concluded a study that found the same companiesovercharged California $6 billion for electricity during part of 2000 and early2001.Generators said the high prices are due to an imbalance in supply and demand inthe state and the high price of natural gas.The ISO has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order generatorsto refund the money to the state s utilities. FERC agreed, but gave generatorsthe benefit of the doubt and asked the companies to substantiate theirelectricity prices or refund the money.Lockyer, whose investigation has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, according to aspokeswoman in his office, is now seeking a whistleblower.\"Anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of afalse claim action may be entitled to percentage share in the award,\" Lockyersaid. \"Since billions of dollars may be recovered, the award to an informantcould potentially range from $50 million to the hundreds of millions of dollars.\"Davis has frequently referred to out-of-state generators as \"greedy profiteers\"and one Sacramento lawmaker has introduced legislation that would place awindfall profits tax on sales of electricity generators earn in the state swholesale market.Lockyer said the state should not be left holding the bag for \"greedy businessdecisions of generators, marketers and utilities\" adding that he will seekcriminal and civil penalties if his investigation finds that generators gougedthe wholesale electricity market.\"Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at theexpense of California pay back what they owe.\"-By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 310-666-9986; jason.leopold@dowjones.com2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

I suggest that since the dispute resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few years. Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to seek such equitable relief. We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them to delay any resolution of this dispute. I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?

The refundwill take the form of deeply discounted forward sales commitments to theutilities.  The impetus for marketers or independent generators to play ballis the threat that FERC may revoke their authorization to make powerwholesales at market-based as opposed to regulated cost-based rates or takesome other punitive step.My concern is that this is a terribly one-sided negotiation.  Marketers andgenerators are being asked to put their profits on the table - profits thatFERC s general counsel s office and FERC itself have concluded they have nopower to touch - and proceed to negotiate against themselves.Enron has good people representing them in these FERC proceedings - SueMara, Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel and, when needed, my colleague RonCarroll.  What I am concerned about is that they do not have a concretestrategy or end game to pursue.  Among other things, Enron  s strategyshould include requiring the utilities, FERC  and the CPUC to put some valueon the table together with the marketers  and generators  profits.  As thesevalues may implicate strategy in the California civil actions, I thought Ishould run my thioughts by you.Specifically, I think Enron (and its allies) should insist that asprecondition of even considering discounted forward sales:1.  FERC and the CPUC must commit to file in the District Ct. actionpleadings in support of a motion ito dismiss the complaints on the ground ofexclusive FERC jurisdiciton.2.  FERC agree to vacate on rehearing as unsupported by substantial evidenceits December 15 finding that rates had been unjust and unreasonable.3.  The utilities and CPUC commit to auctioning off all or some largepercentage of the utilities  retail customer base.There may be other quid pro quo considerations.  I think it is imperativethat Enron decide now what they should be.   Politically (and quite likelycommercially) it is not an option for Enron to pull out of the FERCproceedings.  Therefore, we need to start changing what is at stake in theFERC proceeding and directing it toward our end game.Please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Please update the section of the disclosure for which==20you are responsible for inclusion in the third quarter 2000 Form 10Q .  Als=o,=20please let me know if there are any new items that should be considered.Please respond no later than Monday October 30.Gary3-68413.  Litigation and Other Contingencies Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=f=20which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate==20reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such==20items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse==20impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations. Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=s=20County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners==20under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=r,=20the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,==018 a=20special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =In=20the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated==20state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing==20to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=ain=20times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with==20respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=ed=20the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,==20claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=e=20of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=nd=20factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no==20assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=se=20matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=r=20results of operations. On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=l=20Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,==20bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San==20Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=e=20to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance==20carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=ne=20Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=he=20District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits==20seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and==20property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years==20without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not==20to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =or=20trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the==20explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The==20defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous==20suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal==20court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=n=20believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=n=20County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=d=20not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=ng=20was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which==20granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=n=20Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=s=20stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =the=20OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined==20with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.= =20On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=e=20OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=n=20its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20authorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=n. PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme==20Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for==20review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the==20Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme==20Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=ll=203220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=d=20investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects==20of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE==01,s=20recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan. Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon==20Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=rt=20of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=ver a=20return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=n=20accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility==20Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of==20State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=e=20new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has==20indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionall=y,=20due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,==20with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=ng=20PGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although n=o=20assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=se=20matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=r=20results of operations. Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and==20local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=re=20expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating==20sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to==20result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses==20are not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position= or=20results of operations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a==20potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant==20Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the==20Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=A,=20also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah==20ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant= and=20sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances==20were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these==20allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted==20subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly==20located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November==201998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. =20Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA=. =20Enron does not expect to incur any additional expenditures in connection wi=th=20this site. Enron=01,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater=20remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incu=r=20material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.",

The committee members would be honor-bound not to share information with any branches of their companies able to profit from it.\"They want to be absolved in advance,\" Sulmeyer said. \"What are they so concerned about if they re not doing anything wrong?\"Robert Moore, an attorney representing the voluntary creditors committee, said other committee members such as Bank of America and Merrill Lynch also are requesting safe harbors so they can continue trading stock and remain members.\"At least four members of the committee would have to resign without it,\" Moore told the judge.Montali asked each committee member to file a declaration with the court requesting to trade either commodities (electricity) or securities (stock), and scheduled another hearing on the issue for June 12.-- Associated Press ______________________________ Allan T.

        "body": "Richard, I included a copy of the Berg anti-trust and unfair competitioncomplaint filed by Tom Girardi and others in Los Angeles.  Tom Girardi isthe single best plaintiff s lawyer in southern California.  You may recallhis results against PG&E, Lockheed etc. where recovered billions of dollars.He is well funded and has really good lawyers that work for him. He isreputed to have close associations with many state court judges in LosAngeles. Both Dick Odom and Michael Molland have been opposite Tom Girardifor other clients.  Dick represented Roberts & Stevens in a complicatedsecurities case Fightertown v. Roberts & Stevens  that was tried for 8weeks.   Tom Girardi posted $320M as damages in the case.  He received averdict of $7.0M which was eliminated by Dick s motion for JNOV.  Dick isone of the very few trial lawyers that have gone head to head with Tom insignificant trial and won.  Dick was recently retained in another case whereTom Girardi is the plaintiff s lawyer.  Apparently, we knew somebody whohappened to be with Tom Girardi when he received Brobeck s appearance.  Hiscomment was something to the effect of \"Oh shit. Not those bastards again.\" Not many defendants have the courage to take a case where Girardi isthe plaintiff s counsel to trial.  Very few of the companies that have takenhim to trial have won. Mike Molland has also had several cases opposite Tom Girardi whereMichael represented Browning Ferris Industries as its lead trial lawyer inthe mid 1990s in the serial litigation that arose from the waste disposalcrisis  in Los Angeles County during that time. Girardi s firm sued BFI inthose and other cases during that time.  Michael was able to get BFIdismissed from all but one of those cases early in the process. The othercase was stayed. I know we did not discuss these capabilities when you and Jim werein San Francisco --in large part, because we did not have the Berg complaintin hand at the time.  If Enron is considering lining up local counsel in LosAngeles in the event that it is brought into the Berg case, I hope that youwill consider Dick.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

[ mailto:GFergus@brobeck.com<mailto:GFergus@brobeck.com> ]Sent: Friday, October 06, 2000 2:57 PMTo:  hym@cpuc.ca.gov Cc:  MBD Subject: Enron Proposals Regarding Document SubpoenasImportance: HighHarvey Morris Esq.California Public Utilities Commission505 Public Utilities CommissionSan Francisco, California   94102                Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron PowerMarketing, Inc. (\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and EnronEnergy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation(\"Portland General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"EnronEntities\")Harvey,        Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that theproduction we propose will enable the Commission to commence itsinvestigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all ofthe potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by anystandard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have notwaived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and thatany claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or otherresponses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that areprotected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work productprivileges.        Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documentsfor year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission willbe obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here toduplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.As you will see in the general documents that are offered here forproduction, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of EnronEnergy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage inwholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documentsoffered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron EnergyServices, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do notpropose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4        Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities  businesses, theburden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporateorganizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 issignificant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplarsof their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called\"family trees\" to show its current organization.  To the extent that theEnron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significantorganizational charts, telephone directories or so called \"family trees\" forearlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a listof those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to theother Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the firstwave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6        The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe thisinformation will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for thestaff s purposes.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 11        The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the\"Transaction Documents\") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered whichinformation includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filingsregarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic TransactionDocuments in the second wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18        For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there willprobably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extentthey act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resellgeneration output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to eachgeneration unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose toproduce these documents in the second wave of document productions.         For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless, PortlandGeneral proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction Documentsin summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities,to the extent relevant as discussed below.  We propose that the Commissiondefer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed theinformation of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energyinto the California market.  At that time a more accurate assessment can bemade of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limitedimpact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market.TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19        We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevanttransaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California andReal Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is apurchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want thisinformation, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete orinaccurate.  For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevantwholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect toretail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retailcustomers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing theTransaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20        The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000.        Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then.        We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order.        We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.

        "body": "I m planning to have Rob Walls sign it.  He signed the last one  ( the original notice of dispute to President de la Rua to start the ICSID clock for filing) and Rob is also on the Power of Attorney.  The purpose of this letter is to document all the meetings Guido, Doak and I have had with various government officials, and to restate in writing all the requests for relief we have made to the Argentine government prior to filing the suit.  In a recent BIT case against the Argentine government, the ICSID panel dismissed the claim because the claimant failed to show that it had made an effort to state the relief it sought to the government prior to filing the case.  We have certainly made our requests known to just about every  Argentine official who would listen, but as a matter of precaution we want to get this letter on file before filing, so there is no doubt. Pete, I think Doak is advising Azurix on its BIT claim as well, although I don t know the extent of his involvement.  But thanks for reminding me about that.   Recall that ICSID is the only arbitral system in the world that requires the claimant to fit into various jurisdictional \"pigeon holes\" before it will hear the case. Thus it is important that we communicate with Azurix to avoid either company making contravening jurisdictional statements (the ICSID jurisdictional rules are not specific enough to avoid various interpretations).  We estimate our jurisdictional battle could last at least a year before we get to the merits, but our hope is that we can reach a settlement in the interim.  I ll keep you updated and will meet with you before we file the claim to lay out our strategy and answer any questions.Regards,MichellePeter E Weidler@ENRON01/04/2001 09:09 AMTo: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Eduardo Quintana/TGS@TGS@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Richard B Sanders@ECT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob Walls/NA/Enron@Enron@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re:  That is good progress - who are we planning to have sign the letter to President de la Rua ?

Only those two law firms will be involved from now on.  Doak and Guido also requested the opportunity to review the numbers again at the end of 2001, see where we are and adjust the budget as needed on a yearly basis.  I will be involved in that process as well.  I don t see this as being a big revision or increase, but more of an adjustment depending on the timing and progress of the  proceedings.  In other words, we may not get nearly as far in the jurisdictional proceedings as we have projected for 2001, so we d adjust the numbers accordingly.  I believe this is a very reasonable approach and hope that you and Perez Companc will find it acceptable.  Please let me know if you have any question or concerns that I can answer to expedite this process. We are waiting for your return to send that letter to President de la Rua because we have made changes and I think your input is crucial.

I admit that I don t fully understand the issue, but in essence I m told it s an internal EU directive passed a few years ago (not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet, by the way) that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of the privacy of transmitted data (eg, over the internet).   The EU wants to forbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don t \"adequately protect\" the information.  As always, the EU wants to regulate the issue, while the US prefers self-regulation.  After two years of negotations, they agreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be put in \"safe harbors\", which are basically approved bodies that would check the recipient s ability to protect the privacy of the information, ie, an American company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or offices.  How does this affect Enron?  A couple of other company reps said it is especially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel information, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect us, and do you want us to track down more information?Regards,Steve Burns",

        "body": "At Enron, we re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We re all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we re careful with Enron s money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:?\tProfessional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. \"Professional Services\" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.?\tOn-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  ?\tEnterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.?\tAir travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.?\tLodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit s individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron s list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit s policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.?\tCar rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.?\tOff-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.",

I think you and Rick need to chair the meetingbecause you will lend credibility and importance to the issue. You may evenwant to invite whoever is John Gillis s boss(or his designee) to sit in toemphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear \"Enron has plentyof money\" and \"Thats why we have lawyers\" -the truth being we are theguardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibilityto protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, thestockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that wedo a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety andConstruction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checksregardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement ofthe employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisionseffecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail toact prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is apenalty. The penalty being they won t get the opportunity to lose more ofthe companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I wouldtake with these people. The Weigle case does not need to be looked at likeit only cost us $490.00. This continued reckless disregard we have in ourdecision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we willreplace Foster Wheeler s Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement assomething the EPC Industry talks about.

Once everyone is OK with these, I ll email to Stan and Dave with a brief explanation that our recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from Steve Winston that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement agreement.  1.  Steve Winston s suggested approach is similar to ONEOK s Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern s ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK s PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a \"BTU measurement error\".2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK s PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK s independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a \"special test\" of the accuracy of Northern s ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern s meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern s meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.",

The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  Customer complaints about SoCalGas  windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!Dan Law Offices of Daniel W.

The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. Whether any of the pipeline s proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar s spokesperson said.",

Continuation Charts:\tLooks like the recent move to 2.450 completed the -B- Wave down and we are currently in the -C- wave up of this larger -A- up; -B- down; and  -C- up move.  \tSpecifically, within this -C- wave up:\t2.450 to 2.854 = A up of -C-\t2.854 to 2.630 = B dn of -C-\t2.630 to ????  = C up of -C-; where 2.880 is minimum expected upside target, 2.960 is the pivot, and 3.035 is maximum expected upside target.2.  Spot - 12 Month Strip Spread:\tThis study has thus far accurately called for a feeble rally this winter, with the downtrend continuing into January 2002.3.  Seasonal Price Patterns:\tCalendar January is the highest probability window for the low of the year, then spot tends to rally into late October, with two minor cycles:\tSummer pre-season rally: Typically bottoms in late January, and peaks from mid-April to mid-May.\tWinter pre-season rally: Typically bottoms in late September, and peaks in late October to late November.Conclusion:\tCriteria #2 and #3 point to prices continuing to slide downward into the first part of 2002.  \tCriteria #1 infers significant resistance if prices rally into the 2.880 to 3.305 range.  \tShort to intermediate term trend-followers will be looking to buy strength if we get a close > 2.960.  \tOn the downside, for each day prices don t close > 2.960, the bearish case for a continued decline to the 2.120 to 1.950 area will remain intact. \t Implied volatility is 84%, which is somewhat on the higher part of the volatility scale for natural gas and infers current prices wont stay where they currently are for \tlong.",

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent s Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" Regent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent s core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.",

        "body": "Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. Thank you for your support. Enron Global Technology   -----Original Message----- From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Cc: Subject: Supported Internet Email AddressesEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. Enron Messaging Administration",

Subject:         Importance:     High Rick Please be advised that we have received a request from Morgan Stanley to change the end date of transaction 23454 from 5/31/02 to \"immediately\".  Enron is the counterparty, and they have given their approval to this change.  Following our established rules, since the capacity credit market has already run for 12/28/01, the first day this transaction can be removed is 12/29/01.  Given their recent downsizing efforts, I m not sure Enron is aware that this will create a 35 MW deficiency in their account.  Since the deficiency was not incurred due to load shift, the interval deficiency rate of $16,268 / MW would apply for a total deficiency charge of ~$570,000.  Enron still has the opportunity to make this deficiency up in the daily capacity credit market, if they choose to do so.Please call if you have any further questions on this matter. Tom Thomas M.

The decision is pretty clear on this.As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentionedthat the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission ofcustomer names and DASRs. Let me quote:Section F, p. 19:\"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whetherD.01-09-060 s prohibition of any new contracts for direct accessservices after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities torefuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20contract.\"p.20:\"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission statesotherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to processDASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on orbefore September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilitiesor accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs aresubmitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.\"p.21\"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make itclear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequentCommission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which theycould refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or beforeSeptember 20, 2001.\"Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more languageproviding additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed onOctober 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision iscrystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on orbefore September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after whichyou will not accept those DASRs.So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meetingheld by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPsagreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer listby November 1, with the understanding that additional names andfacilities could be added later with some verification process to ensurethe DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to dothis to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.Enron has met that commitment.Sue Mara(415) 782-7802-----Original Message-----From: Matt.Pagano@sce.com [mailto:Matt.Pagano@sce.com]Sent: Friday, November 02, 2001 2:29 PMTo: dhuddles@enron.comCc: ehughes2@enron.com; gyoung2@enron.com; mevans3@enron.com; Mara,Susan; Riley, Tony; Diane.Romeyko@sce.comSubject: Re: Pending DASR s for Existing Enron CustomersHi Diann,It seems there is a bit of confusion.

Thus far,   my   research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong   argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule   against   retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:   The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may   subject   a utility s rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to   a   methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility s rates   became   subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because   the   formulas are in place before the utility s rates are made subject to   refund.   The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set   forth in the utility s tariffs.  These charges were always subject to   adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The   change   in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very   well   be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change   would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.   I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this   issue.  He concurred with my analysis.   Jeanne   P.S.

Subject: Air Products  Texas Facilities Power Purchase RFP Shortlist CRsI nformation Request 10_24_01 Could you please respond to me by e-mail to the following technical questions to assist me in my review of your proposed power supply agreement (NOTE: if your power supply agreement has been updated from the copy that you provided me with your RFP response please send it to me ASAP): 1.  At this time it is unlikely that Air Products will want to enter into an agreement with a QSE to allow it to bid ancillary services directly into the Ancillary Services market and instead will look to the CR to provide opportunities to Air Products which allow Air Products to utilize its interruptibility capability and thereby reduce its firm power costs.  Could you please provide a detailed explanation as to how you propose to provide opportunities for AP to utilize its Instantaneous and Noticed Interruptible capabilities to reduce its firm power costs, how these opportunities will be communicated to AP, how much time AP will have to respond, how AP s performance will be measured, any special qualification or registration or hardware equipment that AP has to comply with or install, the proposed sharing mechanism for any net profit made, and how participation will be excused from any interval and monthly minimum take obligations. 2.  Please review the attached detailed list of possible CR, ERCOT, TDSP, and non-bypassable charges and note which ones are included in your power price and which ones are proposed to be a pass-through (it would also be helpful to understand if any of these charges are subject to change how often the change might take place).  If a particular charge is partially included and partially passed-through please explain the basis for determining how much is included and how much is passed-through.  If there are any charges that I have not included on this list (other those associated strictly with the power) please add them to the list.  On the bill Air Products will not feel an obligation to pay any charges other than those associated strictly with the power which are not listed in the spreadsheet you return.  <<TDSP and ERCOT Charges Analysis.xls>> 3.  Please confirm whether you are willing to commit to use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the non-regulated delivery charges that are within your control and that all regulated delivery charges will be passed-through at cost with no mark-up. 4.  Will Air Products be allowed to communicate directly with the TDSP regarding outages and repair services? If you have any quesitons concerning this information request please feel free to contact me at 610-481-3497. Roger Yott Air Products   +",

PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista didnot respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records showthat the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day inyear 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both inerror.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy andEnron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh s.  Since thisAssignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommendslanguage to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email fromBlair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E andEnron? Please advise.(2) Avista Energy s original confirmation number 403862 showed a TotalVolume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm \"as is.\"  The brokerconfirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh s.  Therefore, bothPG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh sshould correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counselrecommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (seeemail from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable toPG&E and Enron?  Please advise.To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enronand Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron sconfirm s prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  Wewould like to see those confirms in advance if possible.Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for Januarydeliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as toprevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delaythe start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.

He agrees that you can do a \"back-to-back\" arrangement in the interim between signing and closing--i.e., before you receive the 203 approval for the assignment of the contracts.  Also, you are correct that there is no statutory or regulatory deadline that FERC must meet in granting (or denying) 203 approval.  I can add that in a couple of relatively similar and uncontoversial situations with which we have been involved recently or are otherwise aware of, 203 approval has been received in as short as 45-60 days.  However, it is possible that at this time of year, dealing with summer vacations, it could take somewhat longer even in the most straightforward cases.  Let me know if you need anything else.

We could not for example provide any credible reason for setting up such an entity without revealing our true intent. In addition, the FERC Commissioners are going to be wary about expediting any application at the moment for an Enron entity which does not have an interest in a generating unit, for example.\tAs for Clinton Energy Services Management Inc, which has a power marketing certificate, we are getting an opinion from outside Counsel to confirm that if this entity was moved to become a subsidiary of Enron Corp. that because of the current ownership structure no filing will be necessary with FERC. We at least retain this option and can thereby proceed fairly quickly if required.\tAs to trading without a power marketing certificate I could not support this course of action. In addition, we would probably be in breach of any agreement we have with counterparties enabling them to terminate the agreements immediately.\tIf you need me I will be on 713 533 0313. and will be logged on.\tMarcus",

        "body": "All,I am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous James River contract with BPA under favorable terms.  The signed agreements are on my desk right now.  Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk, the addition of 7.5 MW/h and the change of delivery point have added $22.8 million to the value of the contract.BPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that (i) BPA will deliver 102 MW/h 24/7 for the 5-year term of the agreement (an increase of 7.5 MW/h over the original), (ii) the disputed \"alternative delivery point\" is designated as Mid-C, (iii) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement, (iv) the parties agree to \"book out\" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid-C delivery point (so no power will flow); and (v) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement, just as if the power was still flowing.Although my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement, BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates.  Similarly, I had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out, but BPA refused to do so because--according to BPA s finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark-to-market accounting.  Therefore, we executed two documents:  one amending the original contract, and another called the \"Book-Out Agreement,\" which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years.  I am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because (1) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point, which (2) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River, and (3) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $22 million in value to the contract.

        "body": "Thanks, Guy.  Your point is valid; however, you are right that we don t want to emphasize the intra-day hourly part in this pleading since a firm power contract is necessary in order to have firm network service (hourly traders purchasing system contigent or unit contingent during the day would be scheduling the network transmission utilizing \"non-designated resource\", which makes the transmission less firm (right above non-firm PTP)).  ComEd s draft response also discusses this in the context that they are following the tariff.  The point we need to make is that the designation of firm LD contracts absolutely meets FERC s network resource requirements.We have added an argument that, yet again, even having this type of issue with network, PTP, etc. emphasizes the need to move quickly to the market design that we advocate in the context of an RTO, which would eliminate these parochial issues (and without an icap obligation that Dynegy clearly wants.) -----Original Message-----From: \tSharfman, Guy  Sent:\tThursday, October 25, 2001 3:11 PMTo:\tNicolay, Christi L.; Kingerski, Harry; Steffes, James D.; Herndon, Rogers; Misra, Narsimha; Sager, Elizabeth; Forster, David; Baughman Jr., Don; Stroup, Kerry; Roan, Michael; Migden, Janine; Gahn, Scott; Blachman, Jeremy; Meyn, Jim; Novosel, Sarah; Stroup, Kerry; Will, Lloyd; May, Tom; Baughman, Edward D.; Smith, Mike; Shapiro, Richard; Murphy, Harlan; Black, DonSubject:\tRE: NEED COMMENTS-Dynegy v.

The only point I would make is that our ultimate position is that we don t think we should have to designate any network resource in order to get network firm transmission from the utility.  Our hourly traders don t buy power on firm LD contracts and the utilities in the Midwest have supply imbalance rules that more than adequately incentives us to make sure any power we schedule physically gets to the utility boarder.I am not sure if this filing is the proper time to bring this up, but I wanted to make the point in case it changes our approach.Please let me know if you have any questions.Guy -----Original Message-----From: \tNicolay, Christi L.

Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World s =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World s Leading Company!\"For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets.\"The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn t possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric s masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou=ld actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. \"I had no idea what I d let go of,\" Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother s wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. \"I m interested in the kids. You don t do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can t go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I m not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job,\" he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that wou=ld not have been good for me.\"=20He s a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. \"I m surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa=nding this.\"PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn t help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn t know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call=ed \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company s center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.=20LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn t deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says=, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, \"Let s go.\"The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling s =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty, \"We were in=.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you d expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a=ggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense =of urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn t a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn t live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron s Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn t really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he d speak, I d believe everything he =d say,\" one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another.\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"= sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company s marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn t that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose. \"Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company s hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy s new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke=t accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron s= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t =going to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe=ting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron s domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change s Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn t get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC s nickname qu=ickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store.\" Skilling s approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers  att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =\"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn t close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a=n Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren t necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death.\"BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy =company into the world s leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn t the tim=e for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood.= \"It was the technology era.\"To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO s job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals=, and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn t mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling s contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world s greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark s resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it s best for Rebecca to start= afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business.\"=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely= well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron s domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron s management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron s claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn t put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on.\")But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron s financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"Th=ere wasn t any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they re forgiving of something like accounting,=\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight.\"This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.= \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else. \"=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as= one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that s better suited for good times than bad.\"As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovat=e much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem.\"That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he d always been contemptuous of the long haul; he d always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff s biggest detra=ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he s=ays with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn t work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=act, he is already shopping for office space.\"This is the second wave, and Enron s got it,\" he says, almost breathless. =\"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=et it.\"",

        "body": "Danny,Here s our comments-Paragraph 1ANNGTC s FERC Form 2 filing says that they have received rate base approval for approx. $470 million of past investment (not including AFUDC).  It is unclear how the total cash investment of the withdrawn partners relates to the $470 million number in the Form 2. We acknowledge that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the ANS Producers.  In principle, we are prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but are not prepared to release claims for the $470 MM of past investment because regulators may allow a recovery mechanic, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners.  We thus propose to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the $470 MM, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component.  Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the ANS Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments.Par. 1, footnote **Each ANS Producer that joins will cause the Current and Rejoining Partners  interests to be reduced pro rata, irrespective of when the new partners join.  We should discuss limits on the rights of new partners to join, or a limits on the dilution.  Section 5.2.1 of the partnership agreement sets out a mechanism that discounts the percentage interest acquired by a new partner depending on how long after initial formation that partner joined.  If that mechanism is still in effect, any ANS Producer who joins will face the unpleasant surprise that his interest will immediately be discounted by 15%.Paragraph 2aWe have no information supporting $10 MM of costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills for 2000 and 2001.  The language is ambiguous on what will happen to the \"costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills prior to 2000.\"  How much money did they spend and are they offering to write it off?  Does our payment of our pro rata share of the $10 million permanently absolve us of responsiblity for those costs or have they been buried in the accounts of the partnership somewhere?Paragraph 2bThe idea of a \"success payment\" implies that an entirely new set of customers for the pipeline will be found and new contracts executed.  At one time Northern Natural was a shipper and we believe may have signed a precedent agreement or binding contract (we think the original partners agreed to also contract as customers).  We haven t seen the agreements, but assume they are dead.  If not, we need to kill them. Enron believes it is inappropriate for TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills to obtain a success payment/distribution equal to US$40 MM.  The parents of both companies will enjoy the benefit of increased revenues resulting from volume flows on B==>C segments owned by themselves, which should be a significant financial incentive.[NB: We could advance the idea of asking for an option on participation on the B-C leg next week if Foothills and TCPL won t back off on demanding the $40 million.  I d prefer not to put this in writing yet.]  Paragraph 3While we would like to to preserve the potential ability of the Partnership to seek to include the entire balance of capital contributions plus AFUDC/interest in rate base, since that is almost US $4b, doing so would crater the project s economics.  Instead, preserving just the project s ability to include in rate base the $470 MM that FERC has already blessed may be a more reasonable amount and also have the benefit of prior FERC approval.  Paragraph 4A Rejoining Partner who subsequently withdraw should be allowed to recover its capital contributions without interest/AFUDC at some future date, preferably the first day of commercial operations.  New Percentage Interest will revert to all partners in proportion to their respective current percentage interests.Paragraph 5Enron would like to eliminate this principle.  It would be appropriate for change of control principles to be developed.Paragraph 7Please clarify the principles in which the Partnership Agreement will be amended in order to \"modernize\" provisions for the management of the ANNGTC Partnership.Paragraph 8We couldn t find \"equalizing partners\" referenced as a defined term so we re not sure what this paragraph is talking about.  It might be referring to the \"Additional Capital\" provisions of Par. 12, but that s just a guess.  Paragraph 10Enron can not agree to the principles in a) and b)Paragraph 11William s acquisition of NAPC introduces a material change in control and needs to be discussed.  The size of ANNGTC is such that it could hire its own pipeline operating management and staff in Alaska.[NB: We need to determine when William s acquired control of NAPC.  Drew is investigating.]Paragraph 14We d like to take this out of whatever MOU we end up signing for the same reason we took it out of the confidentiality agreement.  This is just a paraphrase of the withdrawing partner provisions of the Partnership Agreement, coupled with some speculation about what might happen 5 or more years from now.  It doesn t need to be in the MOU.  The only thing this language accomplishes is potentially exposing us to an argument that we waived some rights or were on notice of some claim or position if we end up in a fight with Foothills, TCPL or the Partnership.

        "body": "Here is a summary of my telephone conversation with Jay Hopper of KN Energy:1.  KN has permitted its 550 MW Arkansas plant (and received its Entergy interconnection agreement) and is out for bid on tolling agreements.  They have two counterparties who have bid a 15 year tolling agreement --437 MW, mid 7,000 heat rate; 5.75 KW-mo.; 113 MW duct firing, 4.75 KW-mo.; 3.00 mill escalating variable O&M charge.  KN has also conducted construction bids. [For our LM-6000 activities, seeing all this information would be extremely valuable].2.  KN has a draft air permit on its Jackson Michigan plant.  They will know in 45 days if approved.  All other permits received. Since this project was first in the cue when we last talked to KN, I suspect something negative has happened to slow it down.3.  KN has sites in Oklahoma, Dallas and Chicago (4).  4.  KN and another party have 6 7FA turbines for June  01 projects in Illinois.  KN supposedly controls the turbines.  I asked KN if they would be interested in doing deals in other states with these turbines.  They said possibly.  The other counterparty would need an equity participation in the end project.  I also told them that to the extent that they did Illinois projects, we could be of assistance to them on reg. cap. pricing and sales tax strategies.5.  KN has sites in Ohio and Geary, Indiana where a coal affiliate would take back a 30 year 100 mw PPA for both sites.  Given this contract, KN may entertain doing a deal with a merchant component.6.  I asked Jay how KN would be interested in ENA participating in these projects.  KN is not interested in taking too much commodity risk.  Hence, our proposal of doing a fixed price toll for 5 years and a floating index price for an additional 15 years would not be of interest to them (evidently Kinder laughed at the proposal; though in Jay s telephone message he indicated that Kinder was interested in the structure).  If there was a floor that covered debt service in the merchant years (along with some upside participation for KN--Jay threw out a 20% participation), then they would be interested in doing a deal.  7.  They would also entertain selling a 50% or 100% interest in these projects.8.  Jay told me that KN is looking to make a steady and predictable income from these plants.  Thus far, his group has not made any money.  My sense is that they are looking for money or a story (ENA name).  I would suggest taking a pass at purchasing the Arkansas plant (to get their attention and see their project information) in an effort to get involved in the 7FA and ECAR projects.  If KN does have a long-term tolling agreement, then would should be able to lay off a large portion of the financial risk associated with the Arkansas transaction.  We could also look at applying Don s structure to the Arkansas transaction.  Needless to say, the 7FAs slots, if real, would allow ENA to do something strategic in Florida and Iowa.",

Ben and I had a meeting with Scott this morning. Basic idea is to have 3 and 5 year tolling agreement with Calpine and sell to the market after the expiration of the  agreement.2. Ben prepared a preliminary model. Scott s target unlevered equity IRR is 8.5% ~ 9%. Key value driver will be a capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 or 5 years, which we will charge to Calpine. As soon as we get VOM from EE&CC, we will ask Structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years.3. Things to be done - 3 and 5 year capacity payment to get 8.5% ~ 9% IRR of unlevered equity - 20 year power curve (capacity and energy) for Eastern PJM. We got gas curve. - VOMI think this idea could be good if Calpine is willing to pay more than what we see for next 3 or 5 year Eastern PJM pool price, and/or we can leverage up more by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement.

We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.

My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG s paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I m particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.\t\t -----Original Message-----\t\tFrom: \tHoward, Kevin A.  \t\tSent:\tTuesday, February 12, 2002 10:35 AM\t\tTo:\tHayslett, Rod; Geaccone, Tracy; Chandler, Bob; Saunders, James; Corman, Shelley\t\tCc:\tDesai, Jayshree\t\tSubject:\tNNG 10 year valuation model\t\tI met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -\t\t1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the \"Dynegy transition\" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.\t\t2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?\t\t3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the \"contract roll off\" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.\t\t4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more \"reasonable\" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. \t\t5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.\t\tAny thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.\t\tThanks,\t\tKevin",

        "body": "GISB IS NOW NAESBGISB is now officially NAESB.  (The actual pronunciation is still undetermined!!!)  I may unintentionally go back and forth between the names -- my apologies in advance.  Also, some things are still officially  GISB , such as the operating practices.  There is still transition work to be done.  At times it s a bit confusing and has already come up during a subcommittee meeting.  I m working to keep up with everything in NAESB, at least for a while, to watch for things that affect our quadrant and our processes.AGA is hosting two meetings in January in Washington, D.C. to discuss the retail gas and retail electric quadrants.Numerous meetings are being held by organizations such as NERC.  These are being held in response to the FERC order issued December 19 (RM01-12), which addresses standards development for the wholesale electric industry.  If the industry does not agree on a single standards development organization for wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002, the FERC will either choose one or develop the standards themselves.GISB (NAESB) UPDATE MEETINGSDue to current events at Enron and then the holidays, I haven t held these meetings on a regular basis.  I m working on a regular schedule of meetings.  People have said they want these to continue and prefer them to written updates.  They want to know what s going on in GISB, including what s happening with NAESB.NOPR ON GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDSI ll work with Nancy Bagot on our comments (due February 1).The El Paso pipelines will probably comment on standard 5.3.2 (the FERC asked for comments on whether they should adopt GISB s revisions).  They will also get with INGAA to begin coordination of INGAA s comments.I ll let you know what I hear from other pipelines or other companies.GISB VERSION 1.5Assuming the FERC adopts the version 1.5 standards, the implementation date for the title transfer tracking (TTT) standards is April 18, 2002.  I ll work with the pipelines to ensure we re ready.  As I recall, we ve been in compliance with the proposed standards for a while.  It would be a good idea to double check.The implementation date for the remainder of the standards could be as early as June 1, 2002.I m working to determine the best way to update our copy of the version 1.5 standards to incorporate the corrections noted in the errata.  It is very unlikely that GISB will correct the standards books.  Other than the pipelines, none of the EC representatives have voiced a concern or an interest in having the books corrected.  It will be difficult for our people (business and technical) to use separate documents (the standards books and the errata) when implementing.  And, it will create greater opportunities for error.TRANSACTIONAL REPORTINGI m working with the IR chairs to finalize the data sets.  Next, Technical will develop code values to be used on our Web sites.  The data sets will then be sent to the EC for vote (EBB implementation only at this time) and will probably be included in version 1.6, scheduled for publication on July 31, 2002.  Technical will develop the EDI implementation guides, which will be part of a later publication.INFORMATION REQUIREMENTSENA has said that they will not continue to chair IR.  They may try to participate.  This leaves IR with only one chair.  Dale Davis and I are filling in the gap.  I m not chairing any meetings -- I m only helping outside the meetings.  We have a candidate in mind for IR chair and we re working to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible.  The current chair still is not working out, but the new chair should be able to handle the position and run IR.  The better job the IR chairs do, the less I have to do.We are also working on a few of IR s processes.  This will help to avoid another errata situation like the one we have with version 1.5.  The more complete IR s work product is, the less the NAESB office has to handle it and, therefore, the less they can mess it up.GISB PUBLICATION PROCESSThe task force that is working on the publication process (PPRTF) is picking up speed again (after the holidays).  This group is addressing not only the publication process, but also the approval process for standards.  We meet via conference call every Tuesday and Friday for 1/2 day.  Our work product is due to the EC in time for their February 2002 meeting.  As with IR, the results should help avoid another massive errata, as we have for version 1.5.",

El Paso s tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern s FERC Gas Tariff states that \t\"The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere \twith the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it \tflows.\"It is Northern s position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern s system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.

The panelists w=ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California= - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=idge Group.General ObservationsThe Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. = What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a= couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=andardized -- basically conceding that PJM s system will be implemented in =the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20Locational Marginal PricingThe panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize= the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20FTRs versus FlowgatesThe panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy= Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates= is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a= flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it =s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates= without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=greed upon.FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)= should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs= are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.Options versus ObligationsThe panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are= only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=. =20Let me know if you have any questions.Sarah",

First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers.From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone number is 505/336-8400.Clay",

We believe that meeting customer needs, and exceeding expectationsis not only one of the most important business processes, but also buildsloyalty and increases profits.We would be delighted to have you subscribe to the 2001 multi-client NaturalGas Marketer Customer Satisfaction Study.The main benefit of Mastio s multi-client report is, not only will you beable to discover what customers think of you on 30+ customer serviceattributes, you will also learn what customers think of 45+ other gasmarketers, as well.

Leading companies are responding to this trendby instituting customer service initiatives and measuring their progress,versus customer needs and their competition.Customer satisfaction matters with winning companies, especially forcompanies interested in profitable growth.  These leading companies haveactually moved customer satisfaction from a slogan to reality.  They havemade a commitment to value and are realizing superior growth andprofitability because their business strategies focus on enhancing the valueof what they offer customers.I would like to further point out that our report comes with an electronicversion.  The electronic version allows the segmentation of all therespondents by state, volume, and customer-type, switching status, head tohead comparisons with competitors, etc. The software can be installed onyour network and up to 50 people can query the software at the same time.The biggest advantage is the custom tagging feature.

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:\tISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).\tAny unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).\tInformation related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.

The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  ?\tAfter November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.

Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
