The facility has the track, and room to off-load up to 90 rail cars at one time if necessary. There are three tracks running in parallel, with each track holding 30 cars each. Currently none of the track is being used. With this capacity, the need for storage will be minimal if any, but there is more than enough room to build storage if necessary. As Bob stated, on this property there is two PG&E gas lines, Mohave gas line, the 30\" El Paso Natural gas line also passes through the site. The High pressure Socal gas line does not appear to pass through the property but must be in the area somewhere, as the plant purchases gas to operate there heaters from Socal.  If any or all the company s who have lines in the area, PG&E, Mohave, El Paso, Socal, are interested in this project, this site is ideal. Paramount Refining is very receptive as the rail rack is currently not in service.Who knows how much gas flows through this area? To give you some idea, this site is located on the 15 highway just south of the town Mohave. The ROW for the El Paso gas line (All American) passes through the site and crosses the 15 headed West.\tBob Jacobs 02/01/01 03:58 PM \t  To: Randy Lagrimini/ENRON@enronXgate@ENRON  cc: Bob Burleson/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David Roensch/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Diane Corbett/Long_Beach/Eott@Eott, John Will/ENRON@enronXgate, Kenneth Chow/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Larry Garrett/Long_Beach/Eott@Eott, Randy Rice/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Rick Suderman/Bakersfield/Eott@Eott, Roy Hartstein/ENRON@enronXgate, Susan Ralph/Houston/Eott@Eott  Subject: Re: Gas Injection Project \tGang,Just spoke to a representative from Paramount Refining about setting up a tour to look at their Mojave facility.

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I ve attached a structure diagram below.With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the definition of \"Indebtedness\" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA s counterparty, or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility (although they d likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need to determine where.  Also, I m sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?If you d like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I ll be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next week.Best regards,Stuart---------------------- Forwarded by Stuart Schardin/LON/ECT on 24/02/2000 11:09 ---------------------------Anne Edgley24/02/2000 09:48To: Stuart Schardin/LON/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment---------------------- Forwarded by Anne Edgley/LON/ECT on 24/02/2000 09:49 ---------------------------From: Cynthia Harkness on 23/02/2000 12:28 CSTTo: Mark Evans/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Donette Dewar/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne Edgley/LON/ECT@ECT, Maroun J Abboudy/LON/ECT@ECT, Stephen Dwyer/LON/ECT@ECT, AnnMarie Tiller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James Ginty/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ben F Glisan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment  Dear All,I will be leaving Enron Global Finance this Friday to join Enron Broadband Services, Inc.

You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you please consider the following:1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA s preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance legal group?  Other??Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.Kindest Regards,DMD",

RiskTrack will use Enron Credit data (delivered by Enron to the back-end of the RiskMetrics system), but the application will be managed and delivered by RiskMetrics.The best description of the revenue sharing agreement with RiskMetrics is in the contract itself (see Section 4); there s nothing else I could send you that outlines the development deal more clearly than this. Let me know if this is not what you re looking for.Also, this contract covers our agreement with RiskMetrics to develop \"RiskTrack\"; the end users of RiskTrack will be dealing directly with RiskMetrics for subscriptions, implementation, service, etc. - and will have a contract/agreement with RM and not Enron.

In short, he wants to be behind one and apparently John Sherriff is comfortable with this.  I have therefore asked Ken Raisler to advise us on how to construct a Chinese Wall from a practicle, US perspective, with the intention of having Sanjev at Slaughters modify the \"instruction kit\", as necessary, to work under English law.  Given Ken s involvement on equity trading, he appears to be the right place to start.  There remains the possibility that when the traders see the procedures they will change their minds and wish to stick with the existing procedures you have seen.This will not impact launch of credit trading online which, as advised, is still set for tomorrow.Please let me have any thoughts on this.RegardsPaul",

        "body": "I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.How do we convince customers to participate?Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.Issues:Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.\tAdequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?\tMight make more sense where no current positions exist.\tContract hurdles:\tNeed to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.\tNeed the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.\tMay require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don t work).If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?It s not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can t be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this. -----Original Message-----From: \tKitchen, Louise  Sent:\tTuesday, November 27, 2001 10:03 AMTo:\tTaylor, Mark E (Legal)Subject:\tFW: VMAC Transaction  -----Original Message-----From: \tEichmann, Marc  Sent:\tWednesday, November 21, 2001 2:51 PMTo:\tKitchen, Louise; Lavorato, JohnCc:\tRichter, BradSubject:\tVMAC Transaction Louise and John:Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  Here are the deal highlights:FSA would wrap Enron s credit exposure as follows:1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts.

Their \"angle\" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP s certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this \"retail\" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.These developers recognize that they need Enron s assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:1.  Power Marketing and Project development2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertiseGiven the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don t want to make this email a novel!Thanks a lot.303-575-6473",

You told me that the only way to perhaps determine if other Baytank entities were involved was to ask Philchem, who might or might not know, and who would then be asking questions about what we were going to do next.       Britt\t      P.S. to Richard:  I haven t heard back from Baytank s president, even though I left a voice-mail and sent an e-mail, which was shown on my e-mail receipts as having been read on Tuesday of this week.  In the e-mail, I specifically said that we may be filing suit this week if we didn t get an extension.\tFor the sake of caution, I think we need to file suit Friday afternoon, for reasons I ve mentioned previously.  Shouldn t I send out a GC memo now? -----Original Message-----From: \tDavis, Britt  Sent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 4:26 PMTo:\tElliott, Steven M.Cc:\tStuddert, James P.; Sanders, Richard B.; Zikes, BeckySubject:\tEnron Petrochemicals v. Baytank\tSteve,\tPer your advice, I have removed the \"excessive heat\" allegation in the petition.  How does it look to you now?\tPlease let me know at your earliest convenience.  You confirmed that while we know for sure that the contamination didn t occur prior to October 28, and that it was discovered on or about November 4, we don t know for an absolute certainty that it didn t occur, say, on October 29, 1999.  Accordingly, if Baytank won t grant us an extension of time to file suit against it (and you, Richard and Jim were bcc d on the e-mail I just sent to the president of some Baytank entity asking for such an extension), then I want to be ready to file this suit on Friday.\tA related point:  I have included the name of the Baytank entity with whom Philchem executed the Marketing Agreement, which is the only Baytank corporate entity that I know of that had some responsibility for the contamination.  However, the Marketing Agreement does not say whether that Baytank entity owns, leases or operates the facilities in question.  It would be preferable to name any and all Baytank entites that own, lease or operate the facility in question.  Short of calling Baytank and asking, do you know how we could find this out very quickly?\tMany thanks.\tBritt\tP.S.:  Richard,  should I go ahead and send out a GC memo on this suit, in case Baytank doesn t promptly respond to my request for an extension of time?",

Theproposal to establish methodologies does exactly that, among other things.Therefore, it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pendingCalifornia proceedings.That is not to say, however, that it should not also be part of theChargeback proceedings under the April 6 FERC order.  It should also beapplicable to those proceedings.Therefore, we need to develop a strategy to make it part of bothproceedings.  Timing is obviously critical, and I am soliciting theChargeback movants  views on that subject along with the substance of theproposal.  I would like to point out that I have learned from the settlemen=tproceedings before Judge Wagner that we must submit the proposal early inthe proceedings to ensure that they are considered and can have an impact.I sent an email to Ron Carroll letting him know that I am available for aconference call at the following times:Weds Aug 22 after 11 am Pacific time,Thurs Aug 23 prior to 1 pm Pacific time,Fri Aug 24 anytime except 1130 am to 2 pm Pacific timePlease let me know when we can discuss this further.

It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)?  As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed.Michelle\tJohn Viverito@ENRON\t05/11/2000 02:44 PM\t\t \t\t To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t Subject: Enron and PDI JapanMichelle-Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for your consideration.

Are they a legal entity?  Are they on our payroll?  If they are we filed EEO-1 s for them.    Below is the criteria to file an EEO-1 report:Standard Form 100 must be filed by -A.  All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments, primary and secondary school systems, institutions of higher education, Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor organizations; OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees if the company is owned or affiliated with another company, or there is centralized ownership, control or management (such as central control of personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes a single enterprise, and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more employees. B.  All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract, subcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as a depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes. All multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than one establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees by race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing the name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment employ-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report.All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package.For the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary.The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts.  Their line of thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits indirectly from the contract as well.   If GSP is completely free standing and they do not participate in Enron s benefits, abide by our policies or procedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be funded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to comply  but I doubt it.  If we own them over 51% I don t see a way they could not file EEO-1 s and have an AAP.  We do all the AAP s in Corporate so if this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know.

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do     sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal     government, but we are a  second-tier  contractor, not a  first-tier      contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I     have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him     today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to     abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.     Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare     affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are     subject to an OFCCP audit.     Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not     included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron s     status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1     and AAPs.

I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers.

I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now. After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the \"changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November\".  As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear. These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24. Please inform me of Enron s intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights. I look forward to hearing from you, Regards,  Diomedes Christodoulou.",

Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct \"fool-proof\" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the \"scheduled quantity\" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.

While we will honor currentcommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able touse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happeningis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowingdelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the CityCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind ofagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved bythe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by ourBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keepus operating.I ve attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we aredoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executedcontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the newyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will becomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can t make anychanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about theavailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone wehave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all ourboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are tryingto do here.I Hope most of you will respond.

They have contracted with a single supplier to bring gas in at Carlton for all of USE s clients.  USE wants to bring each shipper s Carlton obligation gas in on the shippers  individual contracts.  Normally, the supplier would have to confirm separate nominations for each little shipper.  Debbie Burgess at USE asked Diana Porter if there was a way that the USE Supplier could nominate the gas to a single USE contract at Carlton, then USE would nominate the Carlton gas from that contract to all the little Carlton sourcers for whom they are agent.I talked with Steve & Dari.  They did not feel there was any tariff/legal obstacle to letting USE do this, as long as the contractcan only be used to facilitate the Carlton sourcing obligation.I talked with Terry Kowalke & Gerry Medeles.  The simplest approach would seem to be an Administrative contract (non-revenue) where USE s supplier would nominate deliveries to the Admin contract and USE would nominate gas from the Admin contract to its clients  individual firm contracts.  Based on those conversations, I told Debbie that it sounded like we could work something out.Problem:  Later, Gerry Medeles determined that, because Carlton has special scheduling logic in TMS, it will require at least 2 weeks worth of system changes to accommodate US Energy s request.With the current work load, Gerry didn t think IT could get the changes made by November 1 but may have something in place for December.Should we pursue?",

El Paso s tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern s FERC Gas Tariff states that \t\"The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere \twith the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it \tflows.\"It is Northern s position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern s system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.\t\t1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry \t\t\tPOI 60022\t\t2.

None of us underestimates the difficulty of this in an election year.  Speaking of elections, we may also want to contact the Riordan campaign.  He came out with some good messages on energy but did not say a peep about retail competition. To the extent we can make it an issue in the campaign, it gets more visibility. We should also consider pushing on John White and company to make green DA a reality.  Some DA is better than none.The fee and rules issue is going to be a grind and likely at the CPUC. As I ve said, it s been hand-to-hand combat with the utilities since 9-20-01. I would like to find a way to work better with the customer groups, because in the end, they are the ones who can carry the day.  Nobody really wants to listen to a bunch of ESPs. The problem is that no one really cares as much as we do -- it s our business afterall.I can t make any promises about Enron or Enron/Dynegy continuing in AReM and I can t predict if/when we might bow out. I think AReM is going to have to pick its spots this year and minimize its expenses whatever it does.  Unfortunately, our experience at the CPUC has been bad.  That would argue for a minimum of activity in the cases and a maximum of lobbying at the Commission and the Leg/Admin. We have to remember that we get all excited about these cases and the issues only to be ignored or harmed when decisions are reached -- especially with certain ALJs. Davis can still get another appointee and things will look even bleaker then.This may sound depressing, but that s reality.  We are the ones carrying on the good fight and the fight must continue.Have a good meeting.  Aloha.Sue",

Linda knows Gail and her husband (it s an old Oklahoma thing), so Linda arranged the lunch for us.On the RTO front, Gail told us that the MD PSC is not opposed to one Northeast RTO.  They see it as inevitable but they do have concerns about the \"contamination\" problem (i.e., PJM is a good, functioning ISO, New York is not, and Maryland does not want PJM to be contaminated by New York).  They were particularly troubled by FERC s statements that \"best practices\" from New York and New England should be included in the new Northeast RTO.I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position.  I said we believe PJM is the best market in the U.S. and the ISO is a sound, independent organization.  I said our traders like the liquidity of the western hub, and our goal has been to spread PJM throughout the rest of the Northeast.  I told her that we too are concerned about contamination from New York, which is why we worked so hard to endorse a plan that put PJM firmly in control of the development of the new RTO market design and of the new RTO.  We discussed how New York and New England are opposed to weighting the board towards PJM, but that we believe (and presumably Maryland would support this position) that the new board must be weighted by PJM board members to ensure proper implementation of the PJM model.  At a minimum, PJM must be in charge of implementing the new market design.Gail also said the MD PSC thought the seams process should be worked out before a single RTO is in place.  I explained to her the problems of the MOU and that we (and most market participants) do not believe that the three ISOs will ever be able to work out the seams issues as long as they remain separate entities.  She was not familiar with the MOU process but seemed to agree that if the seams were not resolved by the entities over the last two years, that it is unlikely that they will ever been resolved.Gail is going to NARUC next week (she s on the gas committee, which Nora asked her to be on earlier this year), and we urged Gail to find Nora and discuss these issues in more detail.  We told Gail that Nora (coming from the Pennsylvania PSC) understands and agrees with the concerns raised by Gail, but that Nora seems to believe that the way to fix the problem is to implement PJM throughout the Northeast.Gail also asked about the State/FERC initiative and asked what happened with the Regional Reliability Organization concept.  I told her I will look in to it and get back to her.As we were finishing lunch, Gail said our discussion was very helpful for her to better understand the issues surrounding a Northeast RTO.  She also said she will try and \"turn down the rhetoric\" from the PSC.  Linda and I again encouraged Gail to talk with Nora next week, and we said we hoped that we (Enron) could work together with the PSC to ensure that the right RTO is implemented in the Northeast.Linda and I were quite pleased with the lunch and are hopeful that we can get something going with Maryland.  Ending Maryland s opposition to a Northeast RTO would be extremely helpful in the political debate that seems to be taking place.Let us know if you have any questions or comments.Sarah",

The agency did not say when the study would becompleted.On Tuesday, the New York Independent System Operator (ISO)released its own cost-benefit study, which asserted thecreation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumerpower bills by some $90 million a year.The non-profit New York ISO would also be put out ofbusiness by a regional for-profit RTO.However, a separate study issued last month by energy firmMirant Corp , a supporter of RTOs, concluded that aNortheastern RTO would save consumers $440 millionannually.At the meeting, FERC commissioners heard staffpresentations on RTO development progress in theSoutheast, Northeast and Midwest.But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERCwill take in guiding utilities.Wood said that more specifics would be available at thenext meeting on Nov. 7, just a month ahead of FERC s Dec.15 deadline for RTO membership.Under FERC s plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups inthe U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Eachregion would combine public utility transmissionfacilities to provide open access, more reliable power andlower rates for consumers.",

I ve discussed this with Elizabeth Sager and Harlan Murphy in ENA Legal, and the following is a very brief summary of aspects of the NOPR that we think Enron should consider opposing.  Comments are due Oct. 5.If approved, FERC s proposed revisions would affect Enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market-based rate authority.Currently, EPMI (and gencos with market-based rate authority) must file the following information quarterly:\t- identification of the buyer/seller;\t- description of the service, (e.g., purchase/sale, firm/non-firm); \t- delivery point(s); \t- price(s) (price per transaction rather than price ranges) \t- quantities, (e.g., MWh/MW); and \t- dates/duration of service (e.g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc.) Such information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction (rather than aggregated) basis.  The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment.The quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs.  Enron should consider objecting to these revisions.  I ve spoken with some of the traders and they agree.  The effect of these requirements would be that Enron s competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction.  FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements.  ENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday.  I would like to have a consensus on Enron s general position by then.  I do not know whether we will be joining EPSA s comments or filing on our own.

It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have \"lost\" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what s right for both E and myself.    To that end,   Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron s assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith.Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the \"back corner.\"The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I m told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.

If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.

Shouldn t the level of firmness be fully defined elsewhere in the confirm.In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to timing along these lines:  \" (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and the quantity of the release or interruption;\"     Since partial quantity releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify quantity and timing.

Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.  The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.  I think this was your greater concern.  In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?  Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less? and for how long?  Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?  For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.  I will be out of the office on Friday 1/4 but look forward to hearing from you early next week.Best Regards,Kevin Hyatt",

They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go forward with their RFP.Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month to month.We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.As a point of reference, RPU s estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is $17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My guess is that it will be around $1mm.I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the routine 2 page proposal format.",

The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.Leslie - could you help me with the letter?Many thanks!Stephanie",

Their \"angle\" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP s certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this \"retail\" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.These developers recognize that they need Enron s assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:1.  Power Marketing and Project development2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertiseGiven the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don t want to make this email a novel!Thanks a lot.303-575-6473",
